I've recommended the Chase Sapphire Preferred to more people than any other credit card. After five years of using it myself—and watching countless friends rack up free flights and hotel stays—I'm convinced it's still the gold standard for anyone getting serious about travel rewards.

But here's the thing: with so many new cards hitting the market, is the Sapphire Preferred still worth it in 2025? Let me break down everything after using this card extensively.

## Chase Sapphire Preferred at a Glance

**Our Rating:** ★★★★½ (4.5/5)

**Best For:** Travel rewards beginners, foodies, anyone who wants premium value without premium fees

**Annual Fee:** $95

**Welcome Bonus:** 75,000 points after $4,000 spend in 3 months

| Category | Earn Rate |
|----------|-----------|
| Travel booked via Chase | 5x |
| Dining & eligible delivery | 3x |
| Streaming services | 3x |
| Online grocery (excludes Target, Walmart) | 3x |
| Other travel | 2x |

## The Welcome Bonus: Let's Talk Numbers

The current 75,000-point bonus is genuinely excellent. Here's what that's actually worth:

- **Chase Travel Portal:** $937.50 (at 1.25¢ per point)
- **Transfer to Hyatt:** $1,125-$1,500+ (at 1.5-2¢ per point)
- **Transfer to United:** $900-$1,200 (depending on routing)

Quick math: You're spending $4,000 to get back $937 minimum. That's a 23% return over three months. Show me a savings account that does that.

The $4,000 spending requirement breaks down to about $1,333 per month. Put your rent, utilities, groceries, and subscriptions on the card, and most people hit it without trying.

**Pro tip:** Time your application before a big purchase. Booking a vacation? Paying quarterly taxes? That's your spending requirement handled.

## Rewards Structure: Where It Shines (And Doesn't)

### The Good

**5x on Chase Travel bookings** is the headline rate, but honestly? I rarely use it. The portal's prices aren't always competitive, and you can't use hotel elite status benefits when booking through third parties.

**3x on dining** is where this card earns its keep. The category includes:
- Restaurants (dine-in and takeout)
- Bars and coffee shops
- Food delivery (DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc.)
- Eligible meal kit services

If you're spending $500/month on dining (not hard in most cities), that's 18,000 points annually—worth $225+ before you even think about other categories.

**3x on streaming** is a nice touch. Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max—it adds up. I earn about 2,000 points yearly just from subscriptions I'd pay for anyway.

### The Not-So-Good

**1x on everything else** feels dated. Cards like the Citi Double Cash give you 2% back on everything with no annual fee. If most of your spending is outside bonus categories, you're leaving value on the table.

**No grocery store bonus** (beyond online orders) is a miss. The Amex Gold crushes here with 4x at U.S. supermarkets.

### Real Earning Example

Here's what I earned last year with typical spending:

| Category | Monthly Spend | Points Earned | Annual Total |
|----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Dining | $600 | 1,800 | 21,600 |
| Travel | $200 | 400-1,000 | 6,000 |
| Streaming | $60 | 180 | 2,160 |
| Everything else | $1,500 | 1,500 | 18,000 |
| **Total** | **$2,360** | **~4,000** | **~48,000** |

That's 48,000 points worth $600-$960 depending on redemption—from a card with a $95 fee.

## Transfer Partners: The Real Value

Here's where the Sapphire Preferred punches way above its weight. Chase Ultimate Rewards transfer to:

**Airlines:**
- United MileagePlus
- Southwest Rapid Rewards
- British Airways Avios
- Air France-KLM Flying Blue
- Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer
- Virgin Atlantic Flying Club
- Iberia Plus
- Aer Lingus AerClub
- Emirates Skywards
- JetBlue TrueBlue

**Hotels:**
- World of Hyatt
- Marriott Bonvoy
- IHG One Rewards

### The Sweet Spots

**World of Hyatt** is the crown jewel. Hyatt points are consistently worth 1.7-2.2¢ each because their award chart hasn't been devalued to oblivion like Marriott's.

I just booked the Park Hyatt Paris (normally $1,200/night) for 30,000 points. That's 4¢ per point—four times what you'd get with cash back.

**United** is solid for domestic flights. Economy awards start at 12,500 miles one-way, and the Excursionist Perk lets you add a free segment on international trips.

**Southwest** matters if you're in their route network. The Companion Pass—where someone flies free with you for nearly two years—is achievable with signup bonuses alone.

## Travel Benefits Worth Knowing

### Primary Rental Car Insurance

This is genuinely valuable. When you book a rental through Chase Travel and decline the rental company's insurance, your Sapphire Preferred provides primary collision coverage.

What does "primary" mean? Chase pays first, not your personal auto insurance. No deductible, no rate increase, no hassle.

I've used this twice. Both times, Chase handled everything. Skip the $25/day rental counter upsell.

### Trip Cancellation/Interruption Insurance

Covers up to $10,000 per person ($20,000 per trip) if you need to cancel for:
- Sickness or injury
- Severe weather
- Jury duty
- Job loss

Last year, my flight got cancelled due to a snowstorm. Chase reimbursed my non-refundable hotel booking within two weeks. No fighting, no drama.

### Other Protections

- **Baggage delay insurance:** $100/day for 5 days if bags are delayed 6+ hours
- **Trip delay reimbursement:** Up to $500 for delays over 12 hours
- **Purchase protection:** 120 days of coverage against damage or theft
- **Extended warranty:** Adds 1 year to manufacturer warranties

## The $95 Annual Fee: Worth It?

Let's do the math on breaking even:

**Scenario 1: Minimum Usage**
- Earn 3x on $200/month dining = 7,200 points/year
- Value: $90 (at 1.25¢) to $144 (at 2¢ via transfers)
- Verdict: Barely breaks even

**Scenario 2: Moderate Usage**
- Earn 3x on $500/month dining = 18,000 points/year
- Earn 2x on $300/month travel = 7,200 points/year
- Total: 25,200 points = $315 to $504
- Verdict: Easily worth it

**Scenario 3: Power User**
- 50,000+ points from spending
- Use transfer partners for 2¢+ value
- Use travel protections (save $100+ on rental insurance alone)
- Verdict: No-brainer

The breakeven point is roughly $250/month in dining. Spend more than that, and the card pays for itself.

## Chase Sapphire Preferred vs. The Competition

### vs. Chase Sapphire Reserve ($550/year)

The Reserve gets you:
- 3x on dining and travel (vs. 2x travel on Preferred)
- Points worth 1.5x in portal (vs. 1.25x)
- Priority Pass lounge access
- $300 travel credit

**My take:** The Reserve makes sense if you travel 5+ times yearly and will actually use lounge access. Otherwise, the Preferred's lower fee is the smarter play.

### vs. Amex Gold ($250/year)

The Gold wins on:
- 4x at restaurants
- 4x at U.S. supermarkets
- $120 dining credit + $120 Uber credit

**My take:** Better for pure dining/grocery rewards. But Chase's transfer partners (especially Hyatt) make the Sapphire Preferred more versatile for travel redemptions.

### vs. Capital One Venture X ($395/year)

The Venture X offers:
- 2x on everything
- Priority Pass lounge access
- $300 travel credit
- 10,000 anniversary miles

**My take:** The Venture X is arguably better for the lounge access and credits, but Chase's transfer partners are superior. I'd pick based on which redemptions you value.

## Who Should Get This Card?

### Perfect For:

- **Travel rewards beginners** who want a simple entry point
- **Foodies** spending $300+/month on dining
- **Flexible travelers** who'll transfer to partners for maximum value
- **Annual fee skeptics** who want premium benefits at a reasonable cost
- **International travelers** (no foreign transaction fees)

### Skip If:

- You spend mostly on groceries (get the Amex Gold)
- You want lounge access (get the Venture X or Reserve)
- You prefer cash back simplicity (get the Citi Double Cash)
- You're under 5/24 and prioritizing other Chase cards

## How to Apply: Maximizing Approval

### Before You Apply

1. **Check your 5/24 status.** Chase denies applications if you've opened 5+ credit cards (any issuer) in 24 months.

2. **Know your credit score.** The Sapphire Preferred typically requires 720+. Check for free on Credit Karma.

3. **Don't apply if you've received a Sapphire bonus in the past 48 months.** Chase's one-Sapphire rule means you can't hold both the Preferred and Reserve simultaneously, and you can't get a bonus if you've had one recently.

### Application Tips

- Apply when you can meet the $4,000 spend requirement easily
- Have a Chase checking account? Existing relationships can help approval odds
- Don't apply for multiple cards the same day—Chase doesn't like velocity

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I upgrade to the Chase Sapphire Reserve later?

Yes, but you won't get a new signup bonus. If you might want the Reserve eventually, apply for it directly. You can always downgrade later, but you can't upgrade for a bonus.

### Is the Sapphire Preferred good for everyday spending?

It's decent—the 1x base rate isn't exciting, but points are worth more than 1¢ when transferred. For non-bonus spending, pair it with a 2% cash back card.

### How long do Chase points last?

Ultimate Rewards points don't expire as long as your account is open and in good standing. No activity requirements.

### Can I transfer points to someone else?

You can transfer to household members who also have Ultimate Rewards cards. Points can also be combined between personal and business Chase cards.

### What credit score do I need?

Aim for 720+. You might get approved with 700, but 720+ significantly improves your odds.

## The Bottom Line

Look, the Chase Sapphire Preferred isn't the flashiest card anymore. No lounge access, no massive travel credits, no metal card that impresses the bartender.

But here's what it does offer: a low $95 fee, a 75,000-point bonus worth $937+, excellent transfer partners, and genuinely useful travel protections. For most people getting into the points game, it's still the right first move.

The card has earned its reputation over the years for a reason. It just works.

**My verdict:** If you spend at least $300/month on dining and take 2+ trips per year, the Sapphire Preferred will pay for itself many times over. Apply during a bonus promotion, transfer points to Hyatt or United, and you'll wonder why you didn't start sooner.

Ready to start earning? The 75,000-point bonus is one of the best we've seen this year.
