I'll say it upfront: the Amex Gold has been in my wallet for three years, and it's not going anywhere. For anyone who spends real money on food—whether that's dining out, groceries, or delivery—this card is basically a cheat code.

But here's the honest truth: it's not for everyone. The $250 annual fee and quirky credits mean you need to actually use this thing strategically. Let me show you whether it makes sense for your spending.

## Amex Gold Card at a Glance

**Our Rating:** ★★★★★ (4.7/5)

**Best For:** Foodies, grocery shoppers, travelers who use Uber, anyone maximizing restaurant spend

**Annual Fee:** $250

**Welcome Bonus:** 60,000 points after $6,000 spend in 6 months (check for elevated 90,000 offers via referral)

| Category | Earn Rate |
|----------|-----------|
| Restaurants worldwide | 4x |
| U.S. supermarkets (up to $25k/year) | 4x |
| Flights booked directly with airlines | 3x |
| Everything else | 1x |

**Standout Credits:**
- $120 Uber Cash annually ($10/month)
- $120 dining credit annually ($10/month at Grubhub, Seamless, Goldbelly, Wine.com, Milk Bar, select Cheesecake Factory locations)
- $100 hotel credit for bookings through Amex Travel (2+ nights)

---

## The Welcome Bonus: What's It Actually Worth?

The standard 60,000-point offer is solid, but here's a pro move: check for targeted offers. Amex frequently sends 75,000 or even 90,000-point offers through targeted mailers, CardMatch, or referral links.

At conservative valuations:

| Points | Value at 1.5¢/pt | Value at 2¢/pt |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| 60,000 | $900 | $1,200 |
| 75,000 | $1,125 | $1,500 |
| 90,000 | $1,350 | $1,800 |

The $6,000 spending requirement over 6 months ($1,000/month) is manageable for most households. Put groceries, dining, and regular bills on the card.

**Fair warning:** Amex has a lifetime language on bonuses. If you've ever had the Gold Card before, you likely won't qualify for another bonus. Check your Amex account for personalized offers that might waive this rule.

## The 4x Categories: Why This Card Dominates

### 4x at Restaurants Worldwide

This is the card's killer feature. Restaurants include:

- Sit-down dining
- Fast food and coffee shops
- Bars and pubs
- Food delivery (DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc.)
- Bakeries and dessert shops
- Some food trucks

At 4x, spending $800/month on dining earns 38,400 points annually. That's $576+ at minimum value—more than double the annual fee from one category alone.

I track my dining religiously. Here's my actual breakdown:

| Restaurant Type | Monthly Avg | Points/Month |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Dinner out | $400 | 1,600 |
| Coffee shops | $80 | 320 |
| Lunch/delivery | $200 | 800 |
| Bars | $120 | 480 |
| **Total** | **$800** | **3,200** |

That's 38,400 points yearly—worth $576 to $768 depending on how you redeem.

### 4x at U.S. Supermarkets (Up to $25k/Year)

This is huge. The cap is $25,000 per calendar year, meaning you can earn 100,000 points just from groceries before hitting the limit.

What counts:
- Kroger, Safeway, Albertsons, Publix, etc.
- Whole Foods and Trader Joe's
- Local grocery chains

What doesn't count:
- Target (even grocery items)
- Walmart (even grocery items)
- Costco (plus they don't take Amex anyway)
- Amazon Fresh (codes as Amazon)

If your household spends $1,000/month on groceries at eligible stores, that's 48,000 points annually. Combined with dining, you're looking at 80,000+ points per year just from food.

### 3x on Flights

Direct airline bookings—not Expedia, not Chase portal, not Amex Travel—just the airlines. This includes:
- Economy, business, first class fares
- Seat selection fees
- Checked bag fees (on airline website)

It's a nice bonus if you're booking flights anyway, though I wouldn't choose this card specifically for airline spend.

## The Credits: Easy Money or Annoying Hassle?

Let's be real: Amex credits have a reputation for being hard to use. The Gold Card's credits are actually pretty manageable.

### $120 Uber Cash ($10/Month)

This one's easy. The credit loads automatically on the first of each month. Use it for:
- Uber rides
- Uber Eats orders
- Uber grocery delivery (in some areas)

**The catch:** Credits don't roll over. Miss a month, lose $10. Set a calendar reminder.

I use mine almost exclusively for Uber Eats on lazy nights. $10 covers most of a meal after fees.

### $120 Dining Credit ($10/Month)

This is trickier. It only works at:
- Grubhub/Seamless
- The Cheesecake Factory
- Goldbelly
- Milk Bar
- Wine.com
- Five Guys (added recently)
- Shake Shack (added recently)

**Real talk:** If you don't naturally use these merchants, the credit has no value to you. I use Grubhub about once a month anyway, so it works for me. But I know plenty of people who let this credit go to waste.

**Pro tip:** Goldbelly ships specialty foods from famous restaurants nationwide. Use your credit there for gifts or special occasions.

### $100 Hotel Credit

Spend $100+ on a 2+ night hotel stay through Amex Travel, get $100 back. Sounds simple, but:
- Must be through Amex Travel portal (often not the best rates)
- Must be 2+ nights (no one-night stays)
- Must be $100+ (cheap motels won't qualify)

I've used this twice in three years. It's a nice bonus when it works, but don't count on it for annual fee math.

---

## Annual Fee Breakdown: Does It Pay Off?

The $250 fee looks steep until you factor in credits:

| Credit | Annual Value |
|--------|--------------|
| Uber Cash | $120 |
| Dining Credit | $120 |
| Hotel Credit | $100 |
| **Total Credits** | **$340** |

If you use all credits, the **effective annual fee is negative $90**. You're actually getting paid to hold this card.

But here's the honest version: most people don't use the hotel credit every year, and some struggle with the dining credit merchants. A realistic assessment:

| Credit | Realistic Value |
|--------|-----------------|
| Uber Cash | $120 (easy) |
| Dining Credit | $60-$120 (depends) |
| Hotel Credit | $0-$100 (depends) |
| **Realistic Total** | **$180-$340** |

Even at $180 in credits, you're paying an effective $70 annual fee. For 4x dining and groceries? Still worth it.

## Membership Rewards: Transfer Partners That Matter

Amex Membership Rewards points transfer 1:1 to some of the best loyalty programs:

### Airlines
- **Delta SkyMiles** - The domestic workhorse
- **ANA Mileage Club** - Incredible for business class to Japan (55k one-way)
- **Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer** - Exceptional first class redemptions
- **Air France-KLM Flying Blue** - Good for Europe and flash deals
- **British Airways Avios** - Short-haul sweet spots
- **Virgin Atlantic Flying Club** - ANA and Delta partner flights
- **Emirates Skywards** - Luxury long-haul
- **JetBlue TrueBlue**
- **Avianca LifeMiles** - Star Alliance redemptions

### Hotels
- **Marriott Bonvoy** (3:4 ratio—3,000 MR = 4,000 Marriott)
- **Hilton Honors** (1:2 ratio—1,000 MR = 2,000 Hilton)

### My Favorite Redemptions

**ANA business class to Tokyo:** 75,000-88,000 points for a $10,000+ ticket. This is the gold standard of points redemptions.

**Delta domestic flights:** Not glamorous, but 12,500-25,000 miles for round trips when Delta runs sales.

**Singapore Airlines Suites:** The ultimate splurge—about 185,000 points from New York to Singapore in the world's best first class.

## Who Should Get the Amex Gold?

### This Card Is Perfect For:

- **Heavy restaurant spenders** ($500+/month dining)
- **Grocery shoppers** at supermarkets (not Target/Walmart)
- **Uber users** who'll actually use the monthly credit
- **Points collectors** building Membership Rewards balances
- **Domestic travelers** who fly Delta often

### Look Elsewhere If:

- **You shop at Target or Walmart** for groceries (they code as discount stores, not groceries)
- **You don't dine out much** (chase the 4x with other cards)
- **You need travel protections** (the Amex Platinum or Chase cards are better here)
- **Amex acceptance worries you** (some merchants abroad don't take it)

## Amex Gold vs. The Competition

### vs. Chase Sapphire Preferred ($95/year)

| Feature | Amex Gold | Chase Sapphire Preferred |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Dining | 4x | 3x |
| Groceries | 4x | 1x |
| Annual Fee | $250 | $95 |
| Credits | $240 | $0 |
| Effective Fee | ~$10-$70 | $95 |
| Transfer Partners | Amex (Delta, ANA) | Chase (United, Hyatt) |

**My take:** The Gold wins on earning, especially if you use the credits. The Sapphire Preferred wins on transfer partners (Hyatt is unbeatable) and lower fee if you won't use Amex credits.

### vs. Capital One SavorOne ($0/year)

| Feature | Amex Gold | SavorOne |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Dining | 4x (4%) | 3% |
| Groceries | 4x (4%) | 3% |
| Annual Fee | $250 | $0 |
| Points System | MR (transfers) | Fixed 1¢ |

**My take:** SavorOne is simpler and free. But Membership Rewards transfers can get 2¢+ per point value—making the Gold's effective earning closer to 6-8% on dining.

### vs. Citi Custom Cash ($0/year)

The Custom Cash offers 5% on your top spending category (up to $500/month). If you spend exactly $500/month on groceries or dining, it technically beats the Gold on that category—but the Gold's unlimited 4x and credits make it better for heavier spenders.

## Practical Tips for Maximizing This Card

### Set Calendar Reminders

- **1st of each month:** Uber credit resets—use last month's if you haven't
- **Monthly:** Check dining credit balance—Grubhub/Goldbelly order?

### Stack With Amex Offers

Check your Amex Offers tab regularly. I regularly get:
- 10% back at specific restaurants
- $10 back on $50+ at certain merchants
- Statement credits at grocery stores

These stack with your 4x earning. I've gotten effective 15%+ back at restaurants with a good offer.

### Use the Amex App

The app tracks your credits, shows Amex Offers, and lets you redeem points. Much easier than the website.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does the Amex Gold have an annual fee?

Yes, $250 per year. But with $240 in credits ($120 Uber + $120 dining), the effective fee can be as low as $10 if you use everything.

### Is the Amex Gold a charge card or credit card?

It's a charge card by default, meaning you're expected to pay in full each month. However, Amex now offers "Pay Over Time" which functions like a credit card with interest.

### Can I get the Rose Gold color?

Yes, you can choose Rose Gold instead of standard Gold when applying or request a card replacement in that color.

### Do Membership Rewards points expire?

Points don't expire as long as your account is open and in good standing. No activity requirements.

### What credit score do I need for the Amex Gold?

Aim for 700+. Amex tends to approve their own customers more easily, so an existing Amex relationship helps.

### Is the Amex Gold better than the Platinum?

Different purposes. The Gold is better for dining and groceries (4x). The Platinum is better for travel perks (lounge access, airline credits, hotel status). Many people hold both.

## The Bottom Line

The Amex Gold isn't trying to be everything to everyone. It's laser-focused on one thing: maximizing returns on food spending. And at that, it's the undisputed champion.

4x at restaurants. 4x at supermarkets. $240 in credits that aren't hard to use. Transfer partners that can get you to Tokyo in business class.

The $250 annual fee sounds high until you realize you're potentially getting $300+ back in value before you even count the points.

**My verdict:** If you spend $500+/month combined on dining and groceries at supermarkets, the Amex Gold will outperform virtually any other card. The math just works.

Not gonna lie—this card has changed how I think about everyday spending. That coffee isn't just $5. It's 20 points toward my next flight.

Ready to start earning 4x on your food? The Amex Gold is waiting.
