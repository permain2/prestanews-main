Your credit score is a three-digit number that can determine whether you get approved for loans, credit cards, apartments, and even jobs. Understanding how credit scores work puts you in control of your financial future.

## What Is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a numerical representation of your creditworthiness—how likely you are to repay borrowed money. Lenders use this score to decide whether to extend credit and at what interest rate.

### Credit Score Ranges

| Score Range | Rating | What It Means |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 800-850 | Exceptional | Best rates and terms available |
| 740-799 | Very Good | Qualifies for most premium products |
| 670-739 | Good | Considered acceptable by most lenders |
| 580-669 | Fair | May qualify with higher rates |
| 300-579 | Poor | Difficulty getting approved |

### Types of Credit Scores

**FICO Score**
- Used by 90% of top lenders
- Ranges from 300-850
- Multiple versions (FICO 8, FICO 9, FICO 10)
- Industry-specific scores for auto and mortgage

**VantageScore**
- Created by the three credit bureaus
- Also ranges from 300-850
- VantageScore 3.0 and 4.0 most common
- More lenient with limited credit history

## How Credit Scores Are Calculated

### The Five Factors (FICO Model)

#### 1. Payment History (35%)

**The most important factor.** Lenders want to know if you pay on time.

**What's Included:**
- Credit card payments
- Loan payments
- Mortgage payments
- Late payments (30, 60, 90+ days)
- Collections
- Bankruptcies
- Foreclosures

**Impact:** One 30-day late payment can drop your score 60-110 points.

#### 2. Amounts Owed / Credit Utilization (30%)

How much of your available credit you're using.

**Credit Utilization Formula:**
```
Total Credit Card Balances ÷ Total Credit Limits × 100 = Utilization %
```

**Example:**
- Balance: $3,000
- Credit Limit: $10,000
- Utilization: 30%

**Target Utilization:**
- Excellent: Below 10%
- Good: Below 30%
- Concerning: Above 50%
- Damaging: Above 75%

#### 3. Length of Credit History (15%)

Longer history = better score (generally).

**What Matters:**
- Age of oldest account
- Age of newest account
- Average age of all accounts
- Time since accounts were used

**Pro Tip:** Don't close old credit cards—they help your average account age.

#### 4. Credit Mix (10%)

Having different types of credit shows you can manage various accounts.

**Types of Credit:**
- **Revolving:** Credit cards, lines of credit
- **Installment:** Auto loans, personal loans, student loans, mortgages
- **Open:** Charge cards (paid in full monthly)

**Ideal Mix:** At least one revolving account and one installment loan.

#### 5. New Credit (10%)

Recent credit applications and new accounts.

**What's Counted:**
- Hard inquiries (credit applications)
- New accounts opened
- Time since last application

**Hard Inquiries:**
- Stay on report for 2 years
- Impact score for about 12 months
- Each inquiry typically drops score 5-10 points

## How to Improve Your Credit Score

### Quick Wins (Days to Weeks)

**2. Become an Authorized User**

- Their positive history helps your score
- Works even without using the card

**3. Request Credit Limit Increases**

- Many issuers allow online requests
- Try after 6+ months of on-time payments

**4. Dispute Errors**

- Accounts that aren't yours
- Wrong credit limits or balances

### Medium-Term Strategies (Months)

**1. Set Up Autopay**
- Never miss a payment
- At least minimum payment automatically
- Payment history improves over time

**2. Keep Old Accounts Open**
- Closing cards hurts utilization and average age
- If no annual fee, keep open
- Use occasionally to prevent closure

**3. Diversify Credit Mix**
- Consider a credit-builder loan
- Apply for installment loan if only have cards
- Don't apply for credit you don't need

**4. Limit New Applications**
- Each hard inquiry impacts score
- Wait 6+ months between applications
- Rate shop within 14-45 days for mortgages/auto

### Long-Term Building (Years)

**1. Establish Long History**
- Keep oldest accounts active
- Time heals negative items
- Patience is your friend

**2. Build Positive Payment History**
- On-time payments every month
- Consistent pattern over years
- Negative items age off (7 years)

**3. Maintain Low Utilization**
- Keep balances low consistently
- Multiple low-balance cards better than one maxed

## Common Credit Score Myths

### Myth 1: Checking Your Credit Hurts Your Score
**Reality:** Checking your own credit is a "soft inquiry" and doesn't affect your score.

### Myth 2: You Need to Carry a Balance
**Reality:** Pay in full every month. Utilization is calculated from statement balance.

### Myth 3: Closing Cards Helps Your Score
**Reality:** Closing cards typically hurts by reducing available credit and average account age.

### Myth 4: Income Affects Your Credit Score
**Reality:** Income isn't part of credit score calculation (though lenders consider it separately).

### Myth 5: All Debt Is Bad for Credit
**Reality:** Responsibly managed debt (paid on time) builds positive credit history.
