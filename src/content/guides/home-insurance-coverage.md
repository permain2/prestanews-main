Your home is likely your largest investment. Homeowners insurance protects that investment from disasters, theft, and liability. Understanding what's covered—and what's not—helps you make informed decisions about your protection.

## What Is Homeowners Insurance?

Homeowners insurance is a package policy that combines multiple types of coverage into one:

- **Property coverage** for your home and belongings
- **Liability coverage** for accidents on your property
- **Additional living expenses** if you can't stay in your home

## The Six Parts of a Standard Policy

### Coverage A: Dwelling

Covers the physical structure of your home, including:
- Walls, roof, and foundation
- Attached garage
- Built-in appliances
- Permanent fixtures (cabinets, flooring, plumbing)

**How Much Do You Need?**
Coverage should equal the cost to rebuild your home (not market value). This is called "replacement cost."

### Coverage B: Other Structures

Covers detached structures on your property:
- Detached garage
- Shed or workshop
- Fence
- Gazebo or pergola
- In-ground pool
- Guest house (limitations apply)

**Typical Limit:** 10% of your dwelling coverage

### Coverage C: Personal Property

Covers your belongings inside the home:
- Furniture
- Electronics
- Clothing
- Appliances
- Sports equipment

**Typical Limit:** 50-70% of dwelling coverage

**Special Limits Apply To:**
- Jewelry: $1,000-2,500
- Cash: $200
- Firearms: $2,500
- Silverware: $2,500
- Electronics: $2,500

**Pro Tip:** For valuable items exceeding these limits, add a scheduled personal property endorsement.

### Coverage D: Loss of Use

Pays additional living expenses if you can't live in your home due to a covered loss:
- Hotel stays
- Restaurant meals
- Temporary rental
- Storage fees
- Pet boarding

**Typical Limit:** 20-30% of dwelling coverage

### Coverage E: Personal Liability

Protects you if someone is injured on your property or you damage someone else's property:
- Medical expenses
- Legal defense costs
- Court judgments
- Settlements

**Standard Limit:** $100,000-300,000
**Recommended:** At least $300,000, consider umbrella policy for more

### Coverage F: Medical Payments

Pays medical expenses for guests injured on your property, regardless of fault:
- Covers smaller injuries without lawsuits
- Quick payment without fault determination
- Typically doesn't apply to household members

**Standard Limit:** $1,000-5,000 per person

## What's Covered: Common Perils

Standard HO-3 policies cover these "named perils" for personal property:

| Peril | Covered? | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Fire and smoke | ✅ Yes | Including wildfires |
| Lightning | ✅ Yes | Direct strikes and surges |
| Windstorm and hail | ✅ Yes | May have separate deductible |
| Explosion | ✅ Yes | |
| Theft | ✅ Yes | Including away from home |
| Vandalism | ✅ Yes | |
| Falling objects | ✅ Yes | Trees, debris, aircraft |
| Weight of ice/snow | ✅ Yes | Roof collapse |
| Water damage | ✅ Partial | Sudden/accidental only |
| Electrical damage | ✅ Yes | Surges from appliances |

## What's NOT Covered: Key Exclusions

### Flood Damage

Standard policies exclude flooding from:
- Rivers, lakes, oceans
- Storm surge
- Heavy rain accumulation
- Overflowing bodies of water

**Solution:** Purchase separate flood insurance through NFIP or private insurers.

### Earthquake Damage

Excluded in standard policies:
- Ground shaking
- Landslides
- Sinkholes (in some states)

**Solution:** Buy earthquake endorsement or separate policy.

### Maintenance Issues

Insurance doesn't cover gradual damage or neglect:
- Mold from ongoing leaks
- Pest infestations
- Wear and tear
- Settling or cracking
- Rust and corrosion

### Intentional Damage

Any damage you cause deliberately is excluded.

### Home Business

Limited coverage for business equipment and liability. Home-based businesses need additional coverage.

### High-Value Items

Items exceeding policy sub-limits need scheduled coverage:
- Fine art
- Jewelry
- Collectibles
- Musical instruments
- Antiques

## Types of Homeowners Policies

| Policy Type | Best For | Coverage Level |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| HO-1 | Basic | Named perils only (rarely sold) |
| HO-2 | Broad | 16 named perils |
| HO-3 | Special | Open perils for dwelling, named for belongings |
| HO-5 | Comprehensive | Open perils for everything |
| HO-6 | Condo owners | Interior and belongings |
| HO-7 | Mobile homes | Similar to HO-3 |
| HO-8 | Older homes | Actual cash value |

**HO-3 is the most common** and offers the best balance of coverage and cost for most homeowners.

## Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value

### Replacement Cost

Pays to replace damaged items with new equivalents:
- 5-year-old TV destroyed → Pays for comparable new TV
- No deduction for depreciation
- Higher premiums but better protection

### Actual Cash Value

Pays current value of items (replacement cost minus depreciation):
- 5-year-old TV destroyed → Pays depreciated value
- Lower premiums but less coverage
- May not be enough to replace items

**Recommendation:** Always choose replacement cost coverage for both dwelling and personal property.

## How to Determine Coverage Amounts

### Dwelling Coverage (Coverage A)

**Don't Use:**
- Purchase price (includes land)
- Market value (fluctuates with real estate market)
- Tax assessment

**Do Use:**
- Replacement cost estimate from insurer
- Local construction costs per square foot
- Professional appraisal

**Formula:**
```
Square footage × Local cost per sq ft × Quality factor = Replacement cost
```

### Personal Property Coverage (Coverage C)

Create a home inventory:

1. **Walk through each room** photographing contents
2. **Record details** (brand, model, purchase date, cost)
3. **Save receipts** digitally
4. **Store inventory** off-site (cloud storage)
5. **Update annually** for new purchases

## Deductibles Explained

### Standard Deductibles

The amount you pay before insurance kicks in:
- Common options: $500, $1,000, $2,500, $5,000
- Higher deductible = Lower premium

### Percentage Deductibles

For wind/hail and hurricanes in some states:
- Calculated as percentage of dwelling coverage
- Example: 2% deductible on $400,000 home = $8,000

### Choosing Your Deductible

| If You... | Consider |
|-----------|----------|
| Have emergency savings | Higher deductible for premium savings |
| Live paycheck to paycheck | Lower deductible for predictability |
| File claims frequently | Lower deductible |
| Rarely file claims | Higher deductible |
