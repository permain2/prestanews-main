If you rent your home, renters insurance is one of the most affordable and valuable policies you can buy. For roughly $15-30 per month, you protect everything you own and shield yourself from costly liability claims.

## What Is Renters Insurance?

Renters insurance (also called tenant insurance) protects your personal belongings and provides liability coverage while you rent an apartment, house, or other dwelling.

**It covers three main areas:**
1. Your personal belongings
2. Your liability for accidents
3. Additional living expenses if you can't stay in your rental

**It does NOT cover:**
- The building itself (landlord's responsibility)
- Your roommate's belongings (they need their own policy)
- Your car (covered by auto insurance)

## Why You Need Renters Insurance

### Your Landlord's Insurance Doesn't Cover You

Your landlord's policy protects:
- The building structure
- Common areas
- Their liability

It does NOT protect:
- Your personal belongings
- Your liability to others
- Your living expenses after a covered loss

### Your Belongings Are Worth More Than You Think

**Quick inventory exercise:**

| Room | Common Items | Estimated Value |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Bedroom | Bed, furniture, clothes, jewelry | $3,000-8,000 |
| Living Room | TV, electronics, furniture, decor | $2,000-6,000 |
| Kitchen | Appliances, cookware, dishes | $1,000-3,000 |
| Bathroom | Personal items, toiletries | $200-500 |
| Office | Computer, desk, supplies | $1,000-4,000 |
| **Total** | | **$7,200-21,500** |

Could you afford to replace everything if it was stolen or destroyed?

### Liability Protection Is Essential

If someone is injured in your apartment, you could be liable for:
- Medical expenses
- Lost wages
- Pain and suffering
- Legal fees

**Example:** A friend trips over your rug and breaks their arm. Medical bills: $15,000+. Without liability coverage, you pay out of pocket.

### Many Landlords Require It

Increasingly, landlords require tenants to carry renters insurance:
- Protects against tenant-caused damage
- Reduces landlord's risk
- Often required in lease agreement

## What Renters Insurance Covers

### Coverage A: Personal Property

Protects your belongings from covered perils:

**Covered Events (Named Perils):**
- Fire and smoke
- Lightning
- Windstorm and hail

### Coverage B: Personal Liability

Protects you if someone sues for injuries or property damage:

**What's Covered:**
- Medical expenses for injured guests
- Property damage you cause
- Legal defense costs
- Court judgments against you

**Examples:**
- Guest slips on wet floor
- Your dog bites a visitor
- You accidentally start a fire that damages neighbor's unit
- Your child breaks a neighbor's window

**Typical Limits:** $100,000-300,000

### Coverage C: Medical Payments

Pays medical expenses for guests injured at your place, regardless of fault:

- Quick payment without lawsuits
- Typically $1,000-5,000 per person

- Storage fees
- Pet boarding

**Example:**
Fire damages your apartment. ALE covers your hotel ($150/night) and meals ($50/day) while repairs are made over two weeks. Total: $2,800.

## How Much Coverage Do You Need?

### Personal Property Coverage

**Step 1: Create a Home Inventory**

Go room by room and document:
- Item description
- Purchase date and price
- Current replacement value
- Photos/receipts

**Step 2: Add Up Total Value**

Be thorough—people typically underestimate by 30-50%.

**Step 3: Choose Coverage Amount**

Select coverage that would replace everything:
- Minimum: $15,000-20,000
- Average: $25,000-40,000
- High: $50,000+

### Liability Coverage

**Minimum recommended:** $100,000

**Consider higher if:**
- You have significant assets to protect
- You host guests frequently
- You have a dog (especially certain breeds)
- You have a pool or trampoline

**Umbrella policy:** For liability above $300,000-500,000

### Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value

**Replacement Cost (Recommended)**
- Pays to replace with new item of similar kind
- No depreciation deduction
- 5-year-old laptop destroyed = new comparable laptop

**Actual Cash Value**
- Pays current value (replacement minus depreciation)
- Lower premiums, less coverage
- 5-year-old laptop destroyed = value of 5-year-old laptop ($50?)

**Always choose replacement cost** for personal property.

## Special Coverage Considerations

### High-Value Items

Standard policies have sub-limits for certain items:

| Item Category | Typical Limit |
|---------------|---------------|
| Jewelry | $1,000-2,500 |
| Cash | $200 |
| Electronics | $2,500 |
| Firearms | $2,500 |
| Silverware | $2,500 |
| Collectibles | Varies |

**Solution:** Schedule valuable items separately (called a "floater" or "rider"):
- Specific items listed by value
- No deductible for scheduled items
- Coverage for more perils (including loss)

### Flood Insurance

Standard renters insurance excludes flooding. If you're in a flood-prone area:
- Purchase separate flood insurance
- Available through NFIP or private insurers
- Covers belongings damaged by rising water

### Earthquake Coverage

Standard policies exclude earthquakes. If you live in earthquake territory:
- Add earthquake endorsement
- Or purchase separate earthquake policy
- Consider deductible (often 10-15% of coverage)

## How to Get Renters Insurance

### Step 1: Determine Your Needs

- Estimate personal property value

### Step 2: Get Multiple Quotes

Compare quotes from:
- Current auto/other insurer (bundling discount)
- Major insurers (State Farm, Allstate, Progressive)
- Online insurers (Lemonade, Jetty, Toggle)
- Independent agents

### Step 3: Compare Policies

Look beyond price:
- Coverage amounts
- Deductible options
- Replacement cost vs. ACV
- Excluded perils
- Customer service ratings
- Claims process

### Step 4: Purchase and Document

- Buy policy before move-in if required
- Provide proof to landlord
- Create home inventory immediately
- Store policy documents safely
