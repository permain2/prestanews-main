American Express has confirmed that the Platinum Card will see its annual fee increase in 2026. While the higher cost raises questions about value, Amex is adding new benefits to sweeten the deal. Here's everything cardholders need to know.

## The New Annual Fee Structure

Starting in 2026, the Amex Platinum annual fee will increase:

- **Current annual fee**: $695
- **New annual fee**: $795 (effective January 2026)
- **Increase**: $100 (14.4% increase)

This marks the largest single increase in the card's history.

## New Benefits to Offset the Cost

American Express isn't just raising prices—they're adding value:

### Enhanced Airline Credit

- **Current**: $200 airline fee credit
- **New**: $250 airline fee credit
- **Expanded eligible expenses**: Now includes Wi-Fi purchases and seat selection fees

### New Streaming Credit

- **Monthly credit**: $20/month ($240 annually)
- **Eligible services**: Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Max, Spotify, Apple Music
- **How it works**: Statement credit on eligible purchases

### Upgraded Hotel Benefits

- **Fine Hotels + Resorts**: $200 experience credit (up from $100)
- **Hotel Collection**: New $150 credit for 2+ night stays
- **Marriott Bonvoy Gold**: Automatic status remains

### Improved Lounge Access

- **Centurion Lounge guests**: Now 2 free guests (previously 0-2 depending on spend)
- **Priority Pass**: Removing restaurant restrictions
- **New partner lounges**: Adding Escape Lounges network-wide

## Breaking Down the Value Proposition

Let's calculate whether the new fee makes sense:

### Statement Credits (Potential Value: $1,640)

| Credit | Annual Value |
|--------|-------------|
| Airline fee credit | $250 |
| Uber credit | $200 |
| Hotel credit | $200 |
| Saks credit | $100 |
| Streaming credit | $240 |
| Entertainment credit | $240 |
| Equinox/Walmart+ | $195 + $13 |
| Clear credit | $189 |
| **Total** | **$1,627** |

### Who Gets Full Value

To fully utilize these credits, you'd need to:

- Fly at least once annually (airline credit)
- Use rideshare services (Uber credit)
- Stay at Fine Hotels + Resorts properties
- Shop at Saks Fifth Avenue
- Subscribe to streaming services
- Have Clear membership

For heavy travelers who naturally use these services, the card delivers exceptional value.

## Comparing to Competitors

### Amex Platinum vs. Chase Sapphire Reserve

| Feature | Amex Platinum (2026) | Chase Sapphire Reserve |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Annual Fee | $795 | $550 |
| Travel Credit | $250 airline | $300 travel |
| Lounge Access | Centurion + Priority Pass | Priority Pass |
| Points Value | 1x-2x MR points | 1.5x-3x UR points |
| Hotel Status | Marriott Gold, Hilton Gold | None |

The Chase card offers simpler value at a lower price point. However, the Amex lounge network remains superior.

### Amex Platinum vs. Capital One Venture X

| Feature | Amex Platinum (2026) | Venture X |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| Annual Fee | $795 | $395 |
| Travel Credit | $250 | $300 |
| Lounge Access | Centurion + PP | Capital One Lounges + PP |
| Points Earning | 5x on flights/hotels | 2x on everything |

Capital One offers compelling value at half the price, though with fewer premium perks.

## Should You Keep or Cancel?

### Keep the Card If:

- You **use Centurion Lounges** regularly
- You **maximize credits** for streaming, Uber, and Saks
- You **value hotel elite status** with Marriott and Hilton
- You **transfer points** to airline partners frequently

### Consider Canceling If:

- You **don't travel frequently** enough to use travel credits
- You **don't use** most statement credit categories
- You **prefer simpler cards** with fewer hoops to jump through
- You **can get similar value** from a cheaper card

### Downgrade Options

If the Platinum no longer makes sense:

- **Amex Gold**: $250/year with strong dining and grocery rewards
- **Amex Green**: $150/year with travel focus
- **Amex EveryDay Preferred**: No annual fee with MR earning

## Timeline and Next Steps

### For Current Cardholders

- **Fee increase applies** at your next renewal after January 2026
- **New benefits begin** immediately for all cardholders in January
- **No action required** to receive new benefits

### For Prospective Cardholders

- **Current sign-up bonus**: 150,000 MR points after meeting spend
- **Strategy**: Apply now, get bonus, evaluate at renewal
- **First year value**: Even with higher fee, bonus offers exceptional value

## Expert Recommendations

### Maximize the New Credits

1. **Set up streaming services** to auto-pay with Platinum
2. **Link Uber account** to earn credit monthly
3. **Plan hotel stays** around Fine Hotels + Resorts properties
4. **Use airline credit** early in the year

### Track Your Utilization

Create a spreadsheet tracking credit usage. If you're consistently under 50% utilization, the card may not be worth keeping.

### Consider Card Combinations

Pairing the Platinum with:
- **Amex Gold** for dining and groceries
- **Amex Blue Business Plus** for everyday spend
- **Chase Freedom Flex** for bonus categories

## The Bottom Line

The Amex Platinum fee increase to $795 is significant, but the added benefits—particularly the streaming credit and enhanced airline credit—help justify the cost for the right cardholder.

The card remains best suited for frequent travelers who value premium lounge access and can utilize the extensive credit system. For those who won't maximize the benefits, alternatives like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Capital One Venture X offer similar experiences at lower annual fees.
