  {
    question: "What is the best VPN in 2025?",
    answer: "<strong>Bamboo VPN</strong> is our top pick for 2025, offering the fastest speeds (950+ Mbps), unlimited device connections, and a verified no-logs policy at just $2.99/month. For security-focused users, <strong>NordVPN</strong> offers advanced features like Double VPN and Threat Protection Pro."
  },
  {
    question: "Are VPNs legal to use?",
    answer: "VPNs are <strong>legal in most countries</strong>, including the US, UK, Canada, and most of Europe. However, some countries restrict or ban VPN use, including China, Russia, Iran, and UAE. Even where legal, using a VPN for illegal activities (piracy, fraud) remains illegal."
  },
  {
    question: "Will a VPN slow down my internet?",
    answer: "Yes, but <strong>premium VPNs minimize the impact</strong>. In our tests, top VPNs like Bamboo VPN and NordVPN reduced speeds by only 5-15%. Free VPNs typically cause 50%+ slowdowns. Using nearby servers and modern protocols (WireGuard, NordLynx) helps maintain speed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a VPN for Netflix?",
    answer: "Yes, <strong>most premium VPNs work with Netflix</strong>. Bamboo VPN, ExpressVPN, and NordVPN consistently unblock Netflix US and other regions. Free VPNs and smaller providers are often blocked. VPN use doesn't violate Netflix's terms but may violate local content licensing."
  },
  {
    question: "Are free VPNs safe?",
    answer: "<strong>Most free VPNs are risky</strong>—they often log your data, inject ads, or sell your browsing history. Exceptions include <strong>ProtonVPN's free tier</strong> (no logs, unlimited data) and <strong>Windscribe</strong> (10GB/month). If budget is tight, these are the only free VPNs we recommend."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'no-logs' policy mean?",
    answer: "A no-logs policy means the VPN <strong>doesn't record your online activity</strong>—no browsing history, IP addresses, or timestamps. The best VPNs (Bamboo, NordVPN, ExpressVPN) have this verified by <strong>independent audits</strong> from firms like Deloitte or PwC."
  },
  {
    question: "How many devices can I connect?",
    answer: "It varies by provider. <strong>Bamboo VPN, Surfshark, and IPVanish offer unlimited connections</strong>. NordVPN allows 10, ExpressVPN allows 8. For families or users with many devices, unlimited connection VPNs provide the best value."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use a VPN on public Wi-Fi?",
    answer: "<strong>Absolutely yes</strong>. Public Wi-Fi (coffee shops, airports, hotels) is notoriously insecure. A VPN encrypts your connection, preventing hackers from intercepting passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data. This is one of the most important use cases for VPNs."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between VPN protocols?",
    answer: "<strong>WireGuard</strong> is the fastest modern protocol, used by most top VPNs. <strong>OpenVPN</strong> is the most trusted and widely audited. <strong>IKEv2</strong> excels on mobile devices. Avoid PPTP (outdated, insecure) and L2TP (slow). Most VPNs auto-select the best protocol."
  },
  {
    question: "Can my ISP see that I'm using a VPN?",
    answer: "Your ISP can see you're <strong>connected to a VPN server</strong>, but cannot see your actual traffic. To hide VPN usage entirely, use <strong>obfuscation/stealth modes</strong> offered by NordVPN (Obfuscated Servers), Surfshark (Camouflage Mode), or ExpressVPN."

          <p>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates an <strong>encrypted tunnel</strong> between your device and a remote server. All your internet traffic passes through this tunnel, hiding your real IP address and protecting your data from prying eyes.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> Why Encryption Matters</h4>
            <p>Without a VPN, your ISP (and anyone on your network) can see every website you visit. With a VPN, they only see encrypted gibberish going to a VPN server. Your actual browsing remains completely private.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>What a VPN Protects</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Your IP address</strong> — Websites see the VPN server's IP, not yours</li>
            <li><strong>Your location</strong> — Appear to be in another country entirely</li>
            <li><strong>Your browsing history</strong> — ISPs can't log or sell your data</li>
            <li><strong>Public Wi-Fi data</strong> — Hackers can't intercept your traffic</li>
            <li><strong>Streaming access</strong> — Bypass geo-restrictions on content</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"/></svg> Key Insight</h4>
            <p>A VPN doesn't make you anonymous—it shifts trust from your ISP to the VPN provider. That's why choosing a <strong>no-logs VPN</strong> that's been independently audited is critical. Bamboo VPN and NordVPN have both passed third-party audits verifying they store no user data.</p>

            <h4>Avoid Free VPNs (With Exceptions)</h4>
            <p>Most free VPNs make money by selling your data or injecting ads—the opposite of privacy. The only free VPNs we recommend are <strong>ProtonVPN Free</strong> (unlimited data, no logs) and <strong>Windscribe Free</strong> (10GB/month). Anything else is likely harvesting your browsing data.</p>
