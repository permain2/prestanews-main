// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is a VPN and why do I need one?",
    answer: "A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, protecting your online privacy. You need one to secure public WiFi connections, bypass geo-restrictions on streaming, prevent ISP tracking, and protect sensitive data from hackers."
  },
  {
    question: "Are VPNs legal?",
    answer: "VPNs are legal in most countries including the US, UK, Canada, and most of Europe. However, some countries like China, Russia, and UAE restrict or ban VPN use. Always check local laws when traveling."
  },
  {
    question: "Will a VPN slow down my internet?",
    answer: "VPNs add some overhead due to encryption, but premium VPNs like NordVPN and ExpressVPN typically reduce speeds by only 10-20%. Modern protocols like WireGuard and NordLynx minimize speed loss significantly."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a free VPN?",
    answer: "Free VPNs often have severe limitations (data caps, slow speeds) and some sell your data to advertisers. ProtonVPN offers the best free tier with unlimited data. For full protection, we recommend paid options."
  },
  {
    question: "Do VPNs work with Netflix?",
    answer: "Premium VPNs like ExpressVPN, NordVPN, and Surfshark reliably unblock Netflix and other streaming services. Free VPNs typically don't work with streaming platforms."
  },
  {
    question: "What's a no-logs policy?",
    answer: "A no-logs policy means the VPN doesn't store records of your online activity. Top VPNs like NordVPN and ExpressVPN have had their no-logs policies independently audited to verify this claim."
  },
  {
    question: "How many devices can I connect?",
    answer: "This varies by provider. Surfshark, PIA, and IPVanish offer unlimited connections. NordVPN allows 10, ExpressVPN allows 8. Check your plan's limits before subscribing."

        <h3 class="font-sora text-xl font-bold text-[#162433] mt-8 mb-4">What to Look for in a VPN</h3>
        <p class="text-[#68727C] mb-4">When choosing a VPN, prioritize these factors:</p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-[#68727C]">
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Look for VPNs with WireGuard or proprietary fast protocols</li>
          <li><strong>Security:</strong> AES-256 encryption, kill switch, and DNS leak protection are essential</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Choose providers with audited no-logs policies outside 14 Eyes countries</li>
          <li><strong>Server Network:</strong> More servers = better speeds and more unblocking options</li>
          <li><strong>Device Support:</strong> Ensure apps exist for all your devices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-sora text-xl font-bold text-[#162433] mt-8 mb-4">How We Test VPNs</h3>
        <p class="text-[#68727C] mb-4">Our testing methodology includes:</p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-[#68727C]">
          <li>Speed tests across 20+ server locations</li>
          <li>Streaming tests with Netflix, Disney+, BBC iPlayer, and more</li>
          <li>Security audits and DNS/WebRTC leak testing</li>
          <li>Real-world usage testing over 30+ days</li>
          <li>Customer support responsiveness checks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-sora text-xl font-bold text-[#162433] mt-8 mb-4">Free vs Paid VPNs</h3>
        <p class="text-[#68727C]">Free VPNs often monetize through ads or selling data. If you need a free option, ProtonVPN's free tier is the only one we recommend. For full protection, speeds, and streaming access, paid VPNs are worth the $3-7/month investment.</p>
