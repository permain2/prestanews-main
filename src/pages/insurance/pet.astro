// FAQ data targeting "People Also Ask"
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is pet insurance really worth it?",
    answer: "<strong>Yes, for most pet owners.</strong> The average cost of emergency vet care is $1,500-$5,000, with surgeries ranging from $3,000-$10,000+. Pet insurance typically costs $20-$50/month for dogs and $10-$30/month for cats. If your pet ever needs emergency surgery, cancer treatment, or chronic disease management, insurance pays for itself many times over. Even one major incident can cost more than years of premiums."
  },
  {
    question: "What does pet insurance actually cover?",
    answer: "Comprehensive pet insurance covers <strong>accidents</strong> (broken bones, lacerations, poisoning) and <strong>illnesses</strong> (cancer, diabetes, infections, allergies). Most plans include diagnostic tests, surgeries, hospitalizations, prescriptions, and specialist care. <strong>Pre-existing conditions are always excluded.</strong> Optional wellness add-ons cover routine care like vaccines and dental cleanings."
  },
  {
    question: "What is NOT covered by pet insurance?",
    answer: "Pet insurance universally excludes <strong>pre-existing conditions</strong>, breeding costs, elective procedures (ear cropping, tail docking), and cosmetic procedures. Most plans also exclude routine care (vaccines, checkups) unless you add wellness coverage. Waiting periods apply—conditions diagnosed before coverage is active aren't covered."
  },
  {
    question: "When is the best time to get pet insurance?",
    answer: "<strong>As soon as possible—ideally when your pet is young.</strong> Premiums are lowest for puppies and kittens (as low as $10-$15/month), and conditions that develop later are covered since they're not pre-existing. The longer you wait, the more likely your pet develops a condition that becomes excluded from coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "How do pet insurance deductibles work?",
    answer: "Most pet insurance uses <strong>annual deductibles</strong>—you pay $100-$500 per year before coverage kicks in. After meeting the deductible, the insurer pays 70-90% of eligible costs. Some insurers (like Trupanion) use <strong>per-condition deductibles</strong>—you pay once per condition, then it's covered at 90% forever. Lower deductibles mean higher premiums, and vice versa."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a good reimbursement rate for pet insurance?",
    answer: "<strong>80% reimbursement is the sweet spot</strong> for most pet owners—it balances premium costs with good coverage. 90% reimbursement costs more but minimizes out-of-pocket expenses for major incidents. 70% is budget-friendly but means paying 30% of every claim. Choose based on your financial comfort with potential vet bills."
  },
  {
    question: "Does pet insurance cover hereditary conditions?",
    answer: "Most modern pet insurance <strong>does cover hereditary and congenital conditions</strong>, including hip dysplasia, heart disease, and breed-specific issues—as long as they weren't pre-existing. This is a critical coverage area, as purebred dogs are prone to expensive hereditary conditions. Always verify this coverage before enrolling."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast do pet insurance companies pay claims?",
    answer: "Claim processing times vary: <strong>Lemonade</strong> leads with AI-powered claims paid in seconds to minutes. <strong>Healthy Paws</strong> and <strong>Pets Best</strong> average 2-5 days. Most insurers take 5-14 days. <strong>Trupanion</strong> bypasses this entirely at participating vets, paying the bill directly at checkout."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you get pet insurance for an older pet?",
    answer: "Yes, but with caveats. Most insurers accept pets up to <strong>age 14</strong>, though some (Lemonade, Healthy Paws) have no upper age limit. Premiums for senior pets are significantly higher, and pre-existing conditions (more likely with age) are excluded. Consider accident-only plans if comprehensive coverage is too expensive."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose between pet insurance companies?",
    answer: "Focus on: <strong>1)</strong> Coverage scope (accidents, illness, hereditary conditions, wellness). <strong>2)</strong> Reimbursement rates and annual limits. <strong>3)</strong> Deductible options. <strong>4)</strong> Claims processing speed. <strong>5)</strong> Customer reviews and complaint history. <strong>6)</strong> Price for your pet's breed, age, and location. Get quotes from 3-5 companies before deciding."

        <!-- How Pet Insurance Works -->
        <div id="how-it-works" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>How Pet Insurance Works</h2>
          
          <p>Pet insurance operates on a <strong>reimbursement model</strong>—you pay the vet bill upfront, submit a claim, and receive a percentage back (typically 70-90%). Unlike human health insurance, there are no networks to worry about; you can use any licensed veterinarian, specialist, or emergency hospital.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> The Reimbursement Process</h4>
            <p>After a vet visit, submit your itemized invoice through the insurer's app or website. Claims are typically processed in 2-14 days (Lemonade does it in seconds). Once approved, you receive reimbursement via direct deposit or check. Some insurers like Trupanion pay the vet directly, eliminating the wait entirely.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Understanding the Key Terms</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Annual Deductible:</strong> The amount you pay out-of-pocket each year before insurance kicks in. Common options range from $100-$500. Lower deductibles mean higher premiums.</p>

          <p><strong>Reimbursement Rate:</strong> The percentage of eligible costs the insurer pays after your deductible. Most plans offer 70%, 80%, or 90%. Higher rates mean higher premiums.</p>

          <p><strong>Annual Limit:</strong> The maximum amount an insurer will pay per year. Options range from $5,000 to unlimited. For comprehensive protection, we recommend at least $10,000 or unlimited.</p>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"/></svg> Key Insight</h4>
            <p>A $5,000 surgery with an 80% reimbursement rate and $250 deductible works out to: <strong>($5,000 - $250) × 0.80 = $3,800 reimbursed</strong>. You'd pay $1,200 out-of-pocket instead of $5,000. That's pet insurance doing its job.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- How to Choose -->
        <div id="how-to-choose" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>How to Choose Pet Insurance</h2>

          <p>The right pet insurance depends on your pet's breed, age, your budget, and how much financial risk you're comfortable with. Consider these factors:</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Factor</th>
                <th>Budget-Focused</th>
                <th>Comprehensive</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Reimbursement</td>

                <td>90%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Annual Limit</td>
                <td>$5,000-$10,000</td>
                <td>Unlimited</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Best For</td>
                <td>Young, healthy pets</td>
                <td>Breeds prone to conditions</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h3>Breeds That Benefit Most</h3>

          <p>Certain breeds are genetically prone to expensive health conditions. Pet insurance is especially valuable for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>French Bulldogs, English Bulldogs:</strong> Breathing issues, spinal problems, skin allergies</li>
            <li><strong>German Shepherds:</strong> Hip dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy</li>
            <li><strong>Golden Retrievers:</strong> Cancer (affects 60% of the breed), hip dysplasia</li>
            <li><strong>Labrador Retrievers:</strong> Joint issues, obesity-related conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Cavalier King Charles Spaniels:</strong> Heart disease (nearly universal)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Pre-Existing Condition Warning</h4>
            <p>No pet insurance covers pre-existing conditions—ever. If your pet is diagnosed with a condition before coverage starts (or during the waiting period), it's excluded permanently. This is why enrolling early, while your pet is healthy, is critical. Don't wait until problems appear.</p>
