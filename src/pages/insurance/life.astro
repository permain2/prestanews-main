const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?",
    answer: "Term life provides coverage for a specific period (10, 20, or 30 years) at lower premiums. Whole life covers you for life, builds cash value, but costs significantly more. Most families benefit from term life."
  },
  {
    question: "How much life insurance do I need?",
    answer: "A common rule is 10-15 times your annual income, but consider your specific situation: debts, children's education, spouse's income, and final expenses. Use online calculators or consult an advisor."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I buy life insurance?",
    answer: "The best time is when you're young and healthy—you'll lock in lower rates. Life events like marriage, buying a home, or having children are common triggers to purchase coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a medical exam for life insurance?",
    answer: "Not always. Many insurers offer no-exam policies for lower coverage amounts or younger applicants. However, policies with medical exams typically offer lower premiums for the same coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "What are living benefits in life insurance?",
    answer: "Living benefits allow you to access part of your death benefit while alive if diagnosed with a terminal, chronic, or critical illness. Many modern term policies include these at no extra cost."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I convert term life to whole life later?",
    answer: "Most term policies include a conversion option that lets you switch to permanent coverage without a new medical exam. This is valuable if your health declines during the term."
