// FAQ data targeting "People Also Ask"
const faqsLegacy = [
  {
    question: "What is the best high-yield savings account right now?",
    answer: "<strong>SoFi Checking and Savings</strong> is our top pick for December 2025, offering up to 4.00% APY with direct deposit, no fees, and no minimums. For pure savings with no checking, <strong>Marcus by Goldman Sachs</strong> offers 4.40% APY. If you have larger balances, <strong>Wealthfront</strong> (4.50% APY) and <strong>CIT Bank</strong> (4.65% APY with $5K+) offer even higher rates."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a good APY for a savings account in 2025?",
    answer: "A good APY in 2025 is <strong>4.00% or higher</strong>. The national average is only 0.46%, so anything above 4% significantly outperforms most banks. Top online banks like Marcus, Wealthfront, and CIT Bank offer APYs up to 4.65%. Avoid traditional banks that often pay under 0.10%."
  },
  {
    question: "Are online savings accounts safe?",
    answer: "Yes, online savings accounts are <strong>just as safe as traditional banks</strong> when they're FDIC insured. All accounts on our list are FDIC insured up to $250,000 per depositor. Some, like Wealthfront ($8M) and Betterment ($2M), offer extended coverage through partner bank networks."
  },
  {
    question: "How much should I keep in my savings account?",
    answer: "Financial experts recommend keeping <strong>3-6 months of living expenses</strong> in an emergency savings account. Beyond that, excess cash should typically be invested for higher long-term returns. A high-yield savings account ensures your emergency fund earns competitive interest while remaining liquid."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between APY and interest rate?",
    answer: "<strong>APY (Annual Percentage Yield)</strong> includes the effects of compound interest, showing your true yearly earnings. Interest rate is the base rate without compounding. Always compare APY, not interest rates, as APY gives you the accurate picture of what you'll earn over a year."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I pay taxes on savings account interest?",
    answer: "Yes, <strong>interest earned is taxable as ordinary income</strong>. Your bank will send a 1099-INT form if you earn more than $10 in interest annually. The tax rate depends on your income bracket. Consider keeping some savings in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs for long-term goals."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I lose money in a high-yield savings account?",
    answer: "No, you <strong>cannot lose your principal</strong> in an FDIC-insured savings account. Your deposits are protected up to $250,000 per bank. However, if inflation exceeds your APY, your money loses purchasing power over time—another reason to maximize your rate."
  },
  {
    question: "How often do savings account rates change?",
    answer: "Rates can change at any time based on the Federal Reserve's decisions. When the Fed raises rates, savings APYs typically increase; when it cuts rates, APYs fall. Online banks tend to adjust rates faster and offer higher APYs than traditional banks regardless of Fed policy."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit on savings account deposits?",
    answer: "There's <strong>no legal limit</strong> on how much you can deposit, but FDIC insurance only covers $250,000 per depositor, per bank. If you have more, consider spreading funds across multiple banks or using accounts like Wealthfront that offer extended FDIC coverage through partner networks."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I have multiple savings accounts at different banks?",
    answer: "Absolutely—many savers use <strong>multiple accounts strategically</strong>. You might use Marcus for emergency savings, Wealthfront for large balances, and SoFi for everyday spending. This also maximizes FDIC coverage if you have over $250,000 in savings."

        <!-- How Savings Accounts Work -->
        <div id="how-it-works" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>How High-Yield Savings Accounts Work</h2>
          
          <p>High-yield savings accounts work exactly like traditional savings accounts but pay <strong>significantly higher interest rates</strong>—often 10x or more than brick-and-mortar banks. Online banks can offer these rates because they don't have the overhead of physical branches.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> Why Online Banks Pay More</h4>
            <p>Without the cost of maintaining physical branches, online banks pass the savings directly to customers as higher APYs. The national average savings rate is just 0.46%—online banks typically offer 4-5%, meaning your money works nearly 10x harder.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Understanding APY</h3>
          
          <p><strong>APY (Annual Percentage Yield)</strong> is the total amount your money earns in one year, including compound interest. Unlike simple interest rates, APY accounts for how often interest compounds (usually daily for savings accounts), giving you the true picture of your earnings.</p>

          <p>For example, with a 4.00% APY:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>$10,000 deposit earns approximately $400 per year</li>
            <li>$50,000 deposit earns approximately $2,000 per year</li>
            <li>$100,000 deposit earns approximately $4,000 per year</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"/></svg> Key Insight</h4>
            <p>The difference between a 0.46% APY (national average) and a 4.50% APY (top online banks) on $25,000 is <strong>$1,010 per year</strong>. Over 5 years, that's over $5,000 in lost earnings from using a traditional bank.</p>

          <h2>How to Choose a Savings Account</h2>

          <p>Selecting the right savings account depends on your balance, access needs, and banking preferences. Consider these key factors:</p>

              <tr>
                <td>Monthly Fees</td>
                <td>$0 monthly fees</td>

                <td>At least $250,000 coverage</td>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Watch Out for Rate Tiers</h4>
            <p>Some banks advertise high APYs but require large minimum balances to earn them. CIT Bank, for example, offers 4.65% APY but requires $5,000+. If you can't maintain the minimum, you might earn as little as 0.25%. Always check the fine print.</p>
