        <h2>Scope of This Policy</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>Consumer Health Data We Collect</h2>

        <p>
          PrestaNews is primarily a financial information website focused on credit cards, insurance, and personal finance. We generally do not intentionally collect consumer health data. However, in limited circumstances, we may collect the following types of consumer health data:
        </p>

        <h3>Insurance-Related Information</h3>
        <p>
          When you use our insurance comparison tools or request quotes for health-related insurance products (such as life insurance), we may collect limited health-related information you voluntarily provide to help match you with appropriate insurance options.
        </p>

        <h3>Voluntary Disclosures</h3>
        <p>
          If you contact us with questions or comments, you may voluntarily disclose health-related information. We will only use such information to respond to your inquiry.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Consumer Health Data</h2>

        <p>We use consumer health data only for the following purposes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Providing Services:</strong> To connect you with insurance providers or financial services you request</li>
          <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> To respond to your inquiries and provide assistance</li>
          <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> To improve our services and user experience</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with applicable laws and regulations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>We do not sell consumer health data.</strong> We will never sell, lease, or trade your consumer health data to third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>Sharing of Consumer Health Data</h2>

        <p>
          We may share consumer health data only in the following limited circumstances:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> When you explicitly authorize us to share your information with a specific third party, such as an insurance provider</li>
          <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With vendors who assist us in providing services, subject to contractual restrictions on use and disclosure</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, court order, or governmental regulation</li>
          <li><strong>Protection of Rights:</strong> To protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or that of others</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights Regarding Consumer Health Data</h2>

          We retain consumer health data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, provide our services, or comply with legal obligations. When consumer health data is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect consumer health data from individuals under the age of 13, or from individuals under 16 without parental consent. If we learn that we have collected such information, we will promptly delete it.
