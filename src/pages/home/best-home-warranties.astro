// FAQ data targeting "People Also Ask"
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is a home warranty worth it?",
    answer: "A home warranty is <strong>worth it for most homeowners</strong>, especially those with older homes or aging appliances. The average HVAC repair costs $300-$600, while a new system costs $5,000-$10,000. With premiums around $400-$600/year and service fees of $75-$125, one major repair can pay for years of coverage. It's also valuable for peace of mind and budget predictability."
  },
  {
    question: "What does a home warranty cover?",
    answer: "Home warranties typically cover <strong>major systems and appliances</strong>: HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning), electrical systems, plumbing, water heaters, refrigerators, ovens, dishwashers, washers, dryers, and garage door openers. Premium plans may include roof leaks, pools, spas, and septic systems. Coverage varies by plan—always read the contract carefully."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between home warranty and homeowners insurance?",
    answer: "<strong>Homeowners insurance</strong> covers damage from events like fire, theft, and natural disasters. <strong>Home warranties</strong> cover mechanical breakdowns and normal wear and tear of systems and appliances. You typically need both: insurance protects your home's structure and belongings, while a warranty handles everyday repair needs."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a home warranty cost?",
    answer: "Home warranties typically cost <strong>$300-$800 per year</strong> ($25-$70/month) depending on coverage level. Service call fees range from $60-$150 per visit. Budget plans start around $35/month, while comprehensive coverage runs $60-$90/month. Multi-year contracts often include discounts of 10-25%."
  },
  {
    question: "Do home warranties cover pre-existing conditions?",
    answer: "Many home warranties <strong>do cover pre-existing conditions</strong> that were unknown at the time of purchase. American Home Shield, Choice Home Warranty, and Liberty Home Guard explicitly cover pre-existing conditions. However, if an inspection revealed a problem before you signed up, it typically won't be covered."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose my own contractor with a home warranty?",
    answer: "Most home warranties <strong>require using their contractor network</strong>, though some offer flexibility. Liberty Home Guard's LHG Cashout option lets you receive cash to hire your own contractor. Some providers allow out-of-network contractors for emergency repairs or when network contractors aren't available."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a home warranty service fee?",
    answer: "A service fee (also called a trade call fee) is the <strong>amount you pay when a technician visits</strong> your home. It typically ranges from $60-$150 per visit, regardless of repair cost. Some providers offer lower monthly premiums with higher service fees, or vice versa—choose based on how often you expect to file claims."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I file a home warranty claim?",
    answer: "Filing a claim is typically easy: <strong>call the 24/7 hotline or submit online</strong>. Describe the problem, and the warranty company will assign a contractor (usually within 24-48 hours). The contractor diagnoses the issue, and if it's covered, repairs proceed. You only pay the service fee—the warranty covers the rest."
  },
  {
    question: "Are home warranties transferable?",
    answer: "Yes, most home warranties are <strong>transferable to new homeowners</strong> when you sell your home. This can be a selling point, as buyers appreciate the added protection. Some providers charge a small transfer fee ($50-$100), while others transfer for free. The new owner continues with the existing coverage terms."
  },
  {
    question: "What isn't covered by a home warranty?",
    answer: "<strong>Common exclusions include:</strong> cosmetic damage, improper installation or maintenance, code violations, and items with existing manufacturer warranties. Outdoor items (sprinklers, fences), structural components, and damage from pests/mold are typically excluded. Always read the contract's exclusions section carefully before purchasing."

          <h2>How Home Warranties Work</h2>
          
          <p>A home warranty is a <strong>service contract</strong> that covers the repair or replacement of major home systems and appliances when they break down due to normal wear and tear. Unlike homeowners insurance (which covers damage from events), warranties protect against mechanical failures.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> The Claims Process</h4>
            <p>When something breaks, call your warranty company's 24/7 hotline or file online. They'll assign a licensed contractor (usually within 24-48 hours) who diagnoses the issue. If covered, repairs proceed immediately. You only pay the service fee—the warranty covers parts and labor.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>What's Typically Covered</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Systems:</strong> HVAC (heating/cooling), electrical, plumbing, water heater</li>
            <li><strong>Kitchen:</strong> Refrigerator, oven/range, dishwasher, garbage disposal</li>
            <li><strong>Laundry:</strong> Washer, dryer</li>
            <li><strong>Other:</strong> Garage door opener, ceiling fans, doorbells</li>
            <li><strong>Premium plans:</strong> Roof leaks, pools, spas, septic systems</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"/></svg> Key Insight</h4>
            <p>The average HVAC replacement costs $5,000-$12,000. A home warranty premium of $500/year with a $100 service fee could save you <strong>$9,400+</strong> on a single major repair. Even one covered claim can deliver years of value.</p>

            <h4>Watch Out for Low Coverage Limits</h4>
            <p>Some budget warranties advertise low premiums but cap coverage at $500-$1,000 per item. Since a new HVAC costs $5,000+, these limits leave you paying the difference. Always check per-item and annual limits before signing up.</p>
