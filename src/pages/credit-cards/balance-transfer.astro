// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is the best balance transfer credit card for 2025?",
    answer: "The <strong>Citi® Diamond Preferred® Card</strong> is our top pick with an industry-leading 21 months of 0% intro APR on balance transfers. For those who want to earn rewards while paying off debt, the <strong>Discover it® Balance Transfer</strong> offers 18 months 0% APR plus cash back with first-year doubling."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save with a balance transfer?",
    answer: "Significant savings are possible. On a $7,500 balance at 24% APR, transferring to a 0% card for 21 months saves you approximately <strong>$2,650 in interest</strong>. Even after a typical 3-5% transfer fee ($225-$375), you're still saving over $2,200. The key is paying off the balance before the intro period ends."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a balance transfer fee?",
    answer: "A balance transfer fee is a one-time charge (typically <strong>3-5% of the transferred amount</strong>) to move your debt. For a $5,000 transfer at 3%, that's $150. Most cards charge 3-5%, but some like Navy Federal Platinum and HSBC Gold offer $0 fees. The fee is almost always worth paying versus continued high interest."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a balance transfer take?",
    answer: "Balance transfers typically take <strong>5-7 business days</strong> to process, though some can take up to 14-21 days. Continue making minimum payments on your old card until you confirm the transfer is complete. Most cards require transfers within the first 60-120 days of account opening to qualify for intro rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Will a balance transfer hurt my credit score?",
    answer: "A balance transfer can <strong>temporarily lower your score</strong> by 5-10 points due to the hard inquiry and new account. However, if the transfer significantly lowers your credit utilization ratio (say, from 80% to 40%), your score may actually improve within 1-2 months. Long-term, paying off debt always helps your score."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I transfer balances between cards from the same bank?",
    answer: "<strong>No</strong>—most banks don't allow balance transfers between their own cards. You cannot transfer a Chase balance to another Chase card, or a Citi balance to another Citi card. You'll need to apply for a card from a different issuer to move debt from your current bank."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when the 0% APR period ends?",
    answer: "When the intro period ends, the card's <strong>regular variable APR kicks in</strong> (typically 17-29% depending on creditworthiness). Any remaining balance will start accruing interest at this higher rate. The goal is to pay off your transferred balance completely before the intro period expires."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I close my old credit card after a balance transfer?",
    answer: "<strong>Usually no.</strong> Closing old cards can hurt your credit score by reducing total available credit (increasing utilization) and shortening credit history. Keep old cards open with zero balance, and make a small purchase occasionally to prevent closure. Only close if the card has an annual fee you won't use."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I make purchases on a balance transfer card?",
    answer: "Technically yes, but <strong>it's often not recommended</strong>. Many cards apply payments to the lowest-APR balance first, meaning new purchases might accrue interest while your transfer stays at 0%. Some cards (like U.S. Bank Platinum) offer 0% on both transfers AND purchases, which is ideal if you need to make new purchases."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need for a balance transfer card?",
    answer: "Most balance transfer cards with good 0% APR offers require <strong>good to excellent credit (670+ FICO)</strong>. The longest intro periods (18-21 months) typically require 700+ scores. If your credit is fair (580-669), you may still qualify for shorter intro periods or secured balance transfer options."

        <!-- How Balance Transfers Work -->
        <div id="how-rewards-work" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>How Balance Transfers Work</h2>
          
          <p>A balance transfer moves existing credit card debt from one card to another—typically to a card with a <strong>0% intro APR</strong>. This lets you pay down your balance without accruing interest during the promotional period.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> How Much Can You Save?</h4>
            <p>On $7,500 at 24% APR, you'd pay <strong>$2,650+ in interest</strong> over 21 months with minimum payments. A 0% balance transfer card eliminates that interest entirely. Even with a 3-5% transfer fee ($225-$375), you save over $2,200.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>The Balance Transfer Process</h3>
          
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Apply for a new card</strong> with a 0% intro APR on balance transfers</li>
            <li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> (online or by phone) with your old account details</li>
            <li><strong>Wait 5-14 days</strong> for the transfer to process</li>
            <li><strong>Continue paying</strong> your old card until transfer confirms</li>
            <li><strong>Pay off the transferred balance</strong> before the intro period ends</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"/></svg> Key Strategy</h4>
            <p>Divide your balance by the intro period months to find your required monthly payment. For $7,500 over 21 months, you need to pay <strong>$357/month</strong> to be debt-free before the 0% rate expires.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>How to Choose a Balance Transfer Card</h2>

          <p>The best balance transfer card depends on your debt amount, payoff timeline, and whether you want additional features. Here's a framework:</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Your Situation</th>

                <th>Best Card</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Large debt, need max time</td>
                <td>Longest 0% APR period</td>

                <td>Lowest ongoing APR</td>
                <td>Navy Federal (11-18% APR)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Want rewards too</td>
                <td>BT + cash back</td>
                <td>Discover it Balance Transfer</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Worried about late payments</td>
                <td>No penalty APR</td>

            <h4>Don't Make This Mistake</h4>
            <p>Avoid making new purchases on your balance transfer card. Most cards apply payments to the lowest-APR balance first, meaning new purchases could accrue interest while your transferred balance stays at 0%. If you need to make purchases, choose a card like U.S. Bank Platinum that offers 0% on both.</p>
