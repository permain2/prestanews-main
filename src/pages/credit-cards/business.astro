// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is the best business credit card for 2025?",
    answer: "The <strong>Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card</strong> is our top pick for most businesses in 2025. It offers a massive 100,000-point welcome bonus worth $1,250+, earns 3X on travel, shipping, internet, cable, phone, and advertising, and transfers to valuable partners like Hyatt and United. The $95 annual fee is easily justified by the benefits."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a business credit card with an EIN only?",
    answer: "Most business credit cards require your <strong>Social Security Number (SSN)</strong> in addition to your EIN because you're personally guaranteeing the debt. However, some corporate cards from American Express and certain business charge cards may allow EIN-only applications for established businesses with strong revenue history."
  },
  {
    question: "Do business credit cards affect my personal credit score?",
    answer: "It depends on the issuer. <strong>Chase, Capital One, and Discover</strong> typically report business card activity to personal credit bureaus. <strong>American Express</strong> and <strong>U.S. Bank</strong> generally don't report to personal bureaus unless you default. All issuers will do a hard inquiry on your personal credit when you apply."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need for a business credit card?",
    answer: "Most business credit cards require <strong>good to excellent credit (670+ FICO)</strong>. Premium business cards like the Business Platinum typically require 720+. No-annual-fee cards like Ink Business Cash may approve scores as low as 660. Your business revenue and history also factor into approval decisions."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a business credit card for personal expenses?",
    answer: "Technically yes, but it's <strong>not recommended</strong>. Mixing personal and business expenses can complicate tax deductions, make bookkeeping difficult, and potentially create legal issues if you have an LLC or corporation. It may also violate the card's terms of service. Keep personal and business spending separate."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a small business card and corporate card?",
    answer: "<strong>Small business cards</strong> require a personal guarantee and are tied to your personal credit. <strong>Corporate cards</strong> don't require personal guarantees, are based solely on business creditworthiness, and typically require $4M+ annual revenue. Most entrepreneurs should use small business cards."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I maximize business credit card rewards?",
    answer: "<strong>1)</strong> Use category cards strategically (Ink Cash for office supplies, Gold for top spending categories). <strong>2)</strong> Stack multiple cards for different expenses. <strong>3)</strong> Time large purchases around welcome bonuses. <strong>4)</strong> Transfer points to airline partners for maximum value. <strong>5)</strong> Pay in full to avoid interest negating rewards."
  },
  {
    question: "Are business credit card rewards taxable?",
    answer: "Generally, <strong>no</strong>. The IRS treats credit card rewards as rebates on purchases rather than taxable income. However, welcome bonuses that don't require spending (like some bank account bonuses) may be taxable. Sign-up bonuses from credit cards that require spending are typically not taxable. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get a cash back or points business card?",
    answer: "<strong>Cash back cards</strong> are simpler — you know exactly what you're earning. <strong>Points cards</strong> can offer more value (1.5-2¢ per point) when transferred to airline partners but require more effort. If you travel frequently for business, points cards like Ink Preferred offer better value. For simplicity, choose cash back like Spark Cash Plus."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I have multiple business credit cards?",
    answer: "Yes! Many business owners carry <strong>3-5 business cards</strong> strategically. Common combos include: Ink Preferred (travel/advertising) + Ink Cash (office supplies) + Amex Gold (restaurants) + a flat-rate card for everything else. Each issuer has their own application rules — Chase's 5/24 rule applies to business cards too."

          <h2>How Business Credit Card Rewards Work</h2>
          
          <p>Business credit cards earn <strong>points, miles, or cash back</strong> on every purchase. The key is matching your card to your spending patterns. A business spending $50K/year on advertising should prioritize different cards than one spending $50K on office supplies.</p>

            <p><strong>Cash back</strong> is simple — earn a percentage back as statement credit. <strong>Points/miles</strong> can be worth 1.5-2¢ each when transferred to airlines, offering more value for frequent business travelers. Choose based on whether you value simplicity or maximum redemption value.</p>

          <h3>Types of Business Credit Cards</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Category Bonus Cards</strong> (Ink Preferred, Amex Gold) earn elevated rewards in specific categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>3-5X on common business expenses like advertising, shipping, travel</li>
            <li>Best for businesses with concentrated spending in bonus categories</li>
            <li>Usually come with annual fees ($95-$695)</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Flat-Rate Cards</strong> (Spark Cash Plus, Blue Business Cash) earn the same rate on everything:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1.5-2% or 1.5-2X on all purchases without category tracking</li>
            <li>Best for businesses with diverse, unpredictable spending</li>
            <li>Simpler to maximize — no strategy needed</li>
          </ul>

            <p>Many business owners use <strong>2-3 cards together</strong>: a category card for high-spend areas (Ink Preferred for advertising), a flat-rate card for everything else (Spark Cash), and a no-fee card for backup (Ink Cash). This maximizes rewards while maintaining flexibility.</p>

          <h2>How to Choose a Business Credit Card</h2>

          <p>The best business card depends on your spending patterns, business structure, and reward preferences. Consider these factors:</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Your Situation</th>

          <h3>Understanding Annual Fees</h3>

          <p>Business card annual fees range from $0 to $695. Higher fees often deliver more value:</p>

          <div class="comparison-boxes">
            <div class="fee-breakdown">
              <h4>Business Platinum ($695/year)</h4>

            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>When No-Fee Cards Make Sense</h4>
            <p>If your business spends less than $25,000/year or you can't use travel benefits, stick with no-annual-fee cards like Ink Business Cash or Blue Business Plus. The welcome bonuses alone provide hundreds in value without ongoing fees.</p>
