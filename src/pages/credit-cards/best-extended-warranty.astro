  {
    question: "How does credit card extended warranty protection work?",
    answer: "Credit card extended warranty protection automatically extends the manufacturer's warranty on eligible purchases made with your card. When your item fails after the manufacturer's warranty expires but within the extended period, you file a claim with your card issuer's benefits administrator."
  },
  {
    question: "What items are covered by credit card extended warranty?",
    answer: "Most credit card extended warranties cover electronics (laptops, TVs, smartphones), home appliances (refrigerators, washing machines), tools, furniture, and sporting goods. Items typically must have an original manufacturer's warranty of 3-5 years or less."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does credit card warranty extension last?",
    answer: "Most cards add 1 year to the manufacturer's warranty, while premium cards like the Amex Platinum and Citi Double Cash offer up to 2 years extension. A product with a 1-year manufacturer warranty could have total coverage of 2-3 years."
  },
  {
    question: "Is credit card extended warranty worth it vs. store warranty?",
    answer: "Credit card extended warranty is almost always the better value since it's free (included with your card). Store warranties typically cost 10-30% of the item's purchase price, while credit card protection is automatic and free."

        <p class="text-[#4B5563] leading-relaxed mb-6">Credit card extended warranty protection is one of the most valuable yet <strong>underutilized credit card benefits</strong>. This free perk automatically extends the manufacturer's warranty on eligible purchases, potentially saving you hundreds or thousands of dollars on repairs and replacements.</p>

        <div class="bg-[#EBF5FF] border-l-4 border-[#0066B2] p-6 rounded-r-xl my-6">
          <h4 class="font-bold text-[#162433] mb-2">💡 The Hidden Value of Extended Warranty</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-[#4B5563]">Store-bought extended warranties typically cost 10-30% of an item's price. A $2,000 laptop might have a $300 store warranty, while your credit card's protection is completely free.</p>
