// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    "question": "What is the best travel credit card for earning rewards?",
    "answer": "The <strong>Chase Sapphire Preferred</strong> consistently ranks as our top pick, offering <strong>2x points on travel and dining</strong> with a 60,000-point welcome bonus. For premium travelers, the <strong>Chase Sapphire Reserve</strong> delivers exceptional value with its <strong>3x points on travel and dining</strong>, plus a $300 annual travel credit that effectively reduces the $550 annual fee to $250."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are expensive travel credit cards worth the annual fee?",
    "answer": "Absolutely, if you travel regularly. Premium cards like the <strong>Chase Sapphire Reserve ($550)</strong> or <strong>American Express Platinum ($695)</strong> offer perks that easily offset their fees: airport lounge access (worth $400+ annually), travel credits, elite status, and enhanced earning rates. If you spend <strong>$4,000+ on travel and dining yearly</strong>, these cards typically pay for themselves."
  },
  {
    "question": "What travel credit cards do frequent travelers use?",
    "answer": "Seasoned travelers often carry a <strong>combination of cards</strong>: the Chase Sapphire Reserve for dining and general travel, an airline co-brand card like the <strong>United Club Infinite</strong> for specific airline benefits, and the <strong>Capital One Venture X</strong> for its flexible redemption options. This strategy maximizes earning rates across different spending categories while securing valuable travel perks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's the best travel credit card under $100 annual fee?",
    "answer": "The <strong>Capital One VentureOne Rewards</strong> (no annual fee) and <strong>Chase Sapphire Preferred ($95 annual fee)</strong> lead this category. The VentureOne offers <strong>1.25x miles on everything</strong> with no fee, while the Sapphire Preferred provides <strong>2x points on travel and dining</strong> plus valuable transfer partners, making the $95 fee worthwhile for most travelers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which travel credit cards work internationally without foreign transaction fees?",
    "answer": "Most top travel cards eliminate foreign transaction fees, including the <strong>Chase Sapphire series, Capital One Venture cards, and American Express travel cards</strong>. This saves you <strong>2.7% on every international purchase</strong>. Cards like the <strong>Capital One Venture X</strong> are particularly valuable abroad due to widespread Visa acceptance and excellent exchange rates."
  },
  {
    "question": "What travel credit card has the best customer service and support?",
    "answer": "The <strong>American Express Platinum</strong> sets the gold standard with <strong>24/7 concierge service</strong> and dedicated travel support. Chase Sapphire Reserve cardholders get access to <strong>Visa Infinite Concierge</strong> and priority customer service. Both cards offer <strong>trip delay protection, baggage insurance, and emergency assistance</strong> that can be invaluable when travel plans go awry."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do travel credit card points compare to cash back?",
    "answer": "Travel points typically offer <strong>25-50% more value</strong> than cash back when redeemed strategically. While cash back gives you <strong>1 cent per point</strong>, travel points can be worth <strong>1.25-2+ cents each</strong> when transferred to airline partners or used for premium cabin redemptions. However, cash back provides more flexibility and simplicity for casual travelers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's the easiest travel credit card to get approved for?",
    "answer": "The <strong>Capital One VentureOne</strong> and <strong>Discover it Miles</strong> have more lenient approval requirements, typically accepting applicants with <strong>good credit (670+ FICO)</strong>. For those building credit, the <strong>Capital One Venture X</strong> secured version offers premium travel benefits. Most premium travel cards require <strong>excellent credit (740+)</strong> and substantial income."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you use multiple travel credit cards together effectively?",
    "answer": "Yes! Smart travelers use a <strong>\"credit card stack\"</strong> strategy: one card for dining and travel (like Sapphire Reserve), another for general spending (Capital One Venture X), and airline co-brand cards for specific benefits. The key is staying organized and ensuring you can meet <strong>minimum spending requirements</strong> without overspending or carrying balances."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should you cancel or downgrade a travel credit card?",
    "answer": "Consider canceling if you're not using benefits worth the annual fee or if you haven't traveled in <strong>12+ months</strong>. However, <strong>downgrading is often smarter</strong> – convert a Sapphire Reserve to a no-fee Freedom card to preserve your credit history and Chase relationship. Cancel only if you can't justify the fee and downgrade options don't exist."

        <div id="how-it-works" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>How to Evaluate Credit Cards</h2>
          <p>Travel credit cards reward your spending with points or miles that you can redeem for flights, hotels, and other travel expenses. Unlike cashback cards, these products focus on maximizing your travel purchasing power through elevated earning rates and valuable transfer partners.

Most travel cards earn 2-5x points on travel purchases and 1-2x points on everything else. The real value comes from welcome bonuses — typically 50,000-100,000 points after meeting minimum spending requirements within the first few months. These bonuses alone can cover several domestic flights or hotel nights.

Cardholders also receive travel-specific benefits like priority boarding, free checked bags, airport lounge access, and travel insurance coverage. Premium cards with higher annual fees typically offer more generous perks that can easily offset the cost for frequent travelers.

• **Points vs. Miles**: Bank points offer flexible transfer options, while airline miles lock you into specific carriers
• **Transfer Partners**: The ability to move points to airline and hotel loyalty programs at 1:1 ratios
• **Redemption Values**: Points typically worth 1-2 cents each, but can reach 3-5 cents through strategic transfers</p>

            <p>A 60,000-point welcome bonus worth $600-$1,200 in travel value often requires just $4,000 in spending over 3 months — that&#039;s immediate 15-30% returns on your regular purchases.</p>

        <!-- How to Choose -->
        <div id="how-to-choose" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>How to Choose the Best travel credit cards</h2>
          <p>Selecting the right travel credit card depends on your spending patterns, travel frequency, and preferred redemption methods. We recommend starting with your annual travel budget and working backwards to find cards that maximize your specific situation.

Consider your primary spending categories first. If you spend $500+ monthly on dining and travel, cards with bonus categories in these areas will outperform flat-rate options. Business travelers should prioritize cards offering airline-specific perks like free checked bags and elite status.

Transfer partners matter significantly for redemption flexibility. Cards partnered with multiple airlines and hotel chains give you more options for maximizing point values. Chase Ultimate Rewards and American Express Membership Rewards offer the most extensive partner networks.

Annual fees require careful calculation. A $550 annual fee card needs to deliver at least $550 in value through welcome bonuses, earning rates, and perks combined. We&#039;ve found that frequent travelers — those taking 4+ trips annually — typically justify premium cards easily.</p>
          
          
          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Avoid These Common Mistakes</h4>
            <p>Don&#039;t chase welcome bonuses without considering long-term value. Many cardholders downgrade or cancel cards after year one, missing out on ongoing benefits that often exceed annual fees for regular travelers.</p>

        <!-- Methodology -->
        <div id="methodology" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>Our Ranking Methodology</h2>
          <p>We evaluated 50+ travel credit cards across quantitative metrics and real-world usability factors. Our analysis included welcome bonus values, ongoing earning rates, annual fee justification, and redemption flexibility through transfer partners.

Each card received scores in six weighted categories, with particular emphasis on long-term value rather than introductory offers alone. We tested redemption processes, customer service response times, and benefit claim procedures to ensure practical usability.

Our recommendations reflect cards that consistently deliver value across different traveler profiles — from occasional vacationers to business road warriors. We update our analysis quarterly to reflect current offers and program changes.
