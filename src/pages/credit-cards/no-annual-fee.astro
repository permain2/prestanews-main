// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is the best no annual fee credit card for 2025?",
    answer: "The <strong>Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express</strong> is our top pick for no annual fee cards. It offers 3% back at U.S. supermarkets, gas stations, and online retailers—all without charging a yearly fee. For simple flat-rate rewards, the <strong>Citi Double Cash®</strong> offers an unbeatable 2% on everything."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you get good rewards without paying an annual fee?",
    answer: "Absolutely. No-annual-fee cards now offer competitive rewards that rival fee-based cards. The Blue Cash Everyday earns 3% in major categories, the Discover it® effectively earns 10% in rotating categories (after first-year match), and the Citi Double Cash earns 2% on everything. Many families earn $500-$800+ in annual rewards from no-fee cards."
  },
  {
    question: "Do no annual fee cards have good sign-up bonuses?",
    answer: "Yes! Most no-annual-fee cards now offer $150-$200 welcome bonuses. The <strong>Chase Freedom Unlimited®</strong> offers up to $300 in value (with the first-year grocery bonus), and the <strong>Discover it® Cash Back</strong> effectively doubles all first-year rewards through its Cashback Match program."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get a 2% flat-rate card or a category bonus card?",
    answer: "It depends on your spending habits. If you spend heavily in specific categories like groceries or gas, a <strong>category card</strong> (like Blue Cash Everyday with 3% groceries) will earn more. If your spending is varied and you don't want to track categories, a <strong>2% flat-rate card</strong> (like Citi Double Cash or Wells Fargo Active Cash) is simpler and more consistent."
  },
  {
    question: "Do no annual fee cards offer 0% intro APR?",
    answer: "Many do! Top options include: <strong>Citi Double Cash®</strong> (18 months on balance transfers), <strong>Chase Freedom Unlimited®</strong> (15 months on purchases and transfers), <strong>Wells Fargo Active Cash®</strong> (15 months), and <strong>Blue Cash Everyday®</strong> (15 months). These make no-fee cards ideal for financing large purchases or paying down existing debt."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need for a no annual fee card?",
    answer: "Most no-annual-fee rewards cards require <strong>good to excellent credit (670+ FICO)</strong>. The Discover it® is more accessible to those with fair credit (640+) or limited credit history. Secured cards are available for those building credit, often with $0 annual fees and upgrade paths to unsecured cards."
  },
  {
    question: "Do no annual fee cards have foreign transaction fees?",
    answer: "Some do, some don't. Cards with <strong>$0 foreign transaction fees</strong> include: Capital One SavorOne, Capital One Quicksilver, Discover it® Cash Back, and Bank of America® Travel Rewards. Cards like Citi Double Cash, Chase Freedom Unlimited, and Blue Cash Everyday charge 2.7-3% on international purchases."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade a no annual fee card to earn more rewards?",
    answer: "Yes, some cards have upgrade paths. The <strong>Blue Cash Everyday®</strong> can upgrade to Blue Cash Preferred® (with $95 fee but 6% groceries). <strong>Chase Freedom cards</strong> can be paired with Sapphire cards to transfer points and boost their value 25-50%. <strong>Citi Double Cash</strong> points can transfer to Citi Premier for airline partner access."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the downsides of no annual fee cards?",
    answer: "The tradeoffs are usually: <strong>1)</strong> Lower earning rates in premium categories (3% vs 4-6% on fee cards). <strong>2)</strong> Fewer premium perks (no lounge access, travel credits, or elite status). <strong>3)</strong> Lower welcome bonuses ($200 vs $500-$1,000+). <strong>4)</strong> Foreign transaction fees on most cards. For light spenders, the math usually favors no-fee cards."
  },
  {
    question: "How many no annual fee cards should I have?",
    answer: "There's no hard limit, but most people benefit from <strong>2-3 complementary no-fee cards</strong>: one for groceries/gas (like Blue Cash Everyday), one for dining/entertainment (like SavorOne), and one flat-rate card for everything else (like Citi Double Cash). This strategy maximizes rewards without paying any annual fees."

          <p>No annual fee credit cards let you earn rewards, cash back, and other benefits <strong>without paying a yearly cost</strong>. They're ideal for people who want to earn rewards without the pressure of "earning back" an annual fee.</p>

            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> The Math Behind No-Fee vs. Fee Cards</h4>
            <p>A card with $0 annual fee earning 2% back beats a $95-fee card earning 3% back unless you spend over $9,500/year. For most Americans spending $20,000-$30,000 annually on credit cards, no-fee cards often provide equivalent or better net value.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Types of No Annual Fee Cards</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Flat-Rate Cash Back Cards</strong> (Citi Double Cash, Wells Fargo Active Cash) earn the same percentage on all purchases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unlimited 1.5-2% back on everything</li>
            <li>No categories to track or activate</li>
            <li>Simple, predictable rewards</li>
            <li>Best for varied spending patterns</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Category Bonus Cards</strong> (Blue Cash Everyday, SavorOne) earn higher rates in specific categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>3-5% back in bonus categories (groceries, dining, gas)</li>
            <li>1% on non-category purchases</li>
            <li>Best for concentrated spending in bonus categories</li>
            <li>Some have quarterly caps on bonus earning</li>
          </ul>

            <p>The best strategy for most people is to <strong>combine 2-3 no-fee cards</strong>: one for groceries, one for dining, and one flat-rate card for everything else. This maximizes rewards without any annual fees cutting into your earnings.</p>
