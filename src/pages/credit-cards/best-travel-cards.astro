const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is the best travel credit card overall?",
    answer: "The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is widely considered the best overall travel card. It offers a strong 75,000-point welcome bonus, excellent earning rates (5X on travel via Chase, 3X on dining), and valuable transfer partners including United, Southwest, Hyatt, and Marriott. The $95 annual fee is easily offset by the benefits."
  },
  {
    question: "How do travel credit card points work?",
    answer: "Travel credit cards earn points or miles on purchases. General-purpose cards (like Chase Sapphire) earn flexible points worth about 1-2 cents each that can be transferred to airlines/hotels or used for any travel. Co-branded cards (like Delta or Hilton cards) earn loyalty points redeemable only with that brand. Most cards offer bonus points in categories like travel, dining, and hotels."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth paying an annual fee for a travel card?",
    answer: "For frequent travelers, yes. Premium cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve ($550/year) include $300 in travel credits, lounge access worth $400+/year, and higher earning rates. If you travel 2+ times per year, the perks often exceed the fee. Occasional travelers may prefer no-annual-fee options like the Wells Fargo Autograph."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need for a travel credit card?",
    answer: "Most travel rewards cards require good to excellent credit (700+ FICO score). Premium cards like the Amex Platinum or Chase Sapphire Reserve typically require excellent credit (750+). However, some no-annual-fee travel cards may approve applicants with good credit in the 670-700 range."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get an airline card or a general travel card?",
    answer: "It depends on your travel habits. Airline co-branded cards (Delta, United, etc.) offer perks like free bags and priority boarding but limit you to one airline. General travel cards (Chase Sapphire, Capital One Venture) offer more flexibility with points transferable to multiple airlines. If you fly one airline 80%+ of the time, get their card. Otherwise, choose a flexible card."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between points and miles?",
    answer: "Points and miles are essentially the same thing with different names. 'Miles' is typically used by airline programs and Capital One, while 'points' is used by Chase, Amex, and Citi. Both represent reward currency worth approximately 1-2 cents each, depending on how you redeem them."
  },
  {
    question: "Do travel credit cards charge foreign transaction fees?",
    answer: "Most premium travel cards do NOT charge foreign transaction fees (typically 3% of purchases abroad). This is a key feature to look for if you travel internationally. All cards on this page have no foreign transaction fees, but always verify before applying."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I maximize my travel credit card rewards?",
    answer: "1) Put all spending on your card and pay in full monthly. 2) Use the right card for each category (dining card for restaurants, travel card for flights). 3) Transfer points to airline partners for premium cabin flights when the value exceeds 2 cents/point. 4) Take advantage of all credits and perks. 5) Time large purchases around welcome bonus requirements."

      <!-- How Travel Rewards Work -->
      <div id="how-rewards-work">
        <h2>How Travel Credit Card Rewards Work</h2>
        
        <p>Travel credit cards earn points or miles every time you make a purchase. The value of these rewards typically ranges from <strong>1 to 2 cents per point</strong>, depending on how you redeem them. Understanding the basics helps you maximize your rewards.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h4>💡 Points vs. Miles: What's the Difference?</h4>
          <p>"Points" and "miles" are essentially the same thing—reward currency with different names. Chase and Amex use "points," while airlines and Capital One use "miles." Both are worth approximately 1-2 cents each.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Types of Travel Rewards Cards</h3>
        
        <p><strong>General-Purpose Travel Cards</strong> (like Chase Sapphire or Capital One Venture) earn flexible points that can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Transfer to 10-20+ airline and hotel partners</li>
          <li>Be redeemed for any travel purchase as statement credit</li>
          <li>Book travel through the issuer's portal</li>
          <li>Sometimes convert to cash back (at lower value)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Co-Branded Airline/Hotel Cards</strong> (like Delta SkyMiles or Marriott Bonvoy) earn loyalty points redeemable only with that brand, but offer perks like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Free checked bags (worth $70+ per roundtrip)</li>
          <li>Priority boarding and upgrades</li>
          <li>Elite status credits</li>
          <li>Companion certificates</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- How to Choose -->
      <div id="how-to-choose">
        <h2>How to Choose a Travel Credit Card</h2>

        <p>The best travel card for you depends on your travel habits, spending patterns, and how much you value flexibility versus brand-specific perks.</p>

        <h3>Key Questions to Ask Yourself</h3>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Question</th>
              <th>If Yes...</th>
              <th>If No...</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Do you fly one airline 80%+ of the time?</td>
              <td>Get that airline's co-branded card</td>
              <td>Choose a flexible card like Chase Sapphire</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Do you travel internationally?</td>
              <td>Prioritize no foreign transaction fees</td>
              <td>Focus on domestic perks</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Can you spend $3,000-$5,000 in 3 months?</td>
              <td>Go for cards with large bonuses</td>
              <td>Choose cards with lower spend requirements</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Do you value lounge access?</td>
              <td>Consider premium cards ($400+ fee)</td>
              <td>Mid-tier cards offer better value</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Annual Fee Considerations</h3>

        <p>Don't let annual fees scare you away. Premium cards often provide more value than their fee:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chase Sapphire Reserve ($550):</strong> $300 travel credit + lounge access + higher earning = $800+ value for frequent travelers</li>
          <li><strong>Capital One Venture X ($395):</strong> $300 travel credit + 10,000 bonus miles yearly = fee essentially $0</li>
          <li><strong>Amex Platinum ($695):</strong> Over $1,500 in credits if you maximize all benefits</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
          <h4>⚠️ When to Avoid Annual Fee Cards</h4>
          <p>If you travel less than twice per year or won't use the credits/perks, stick with no-annual-fee options like the Wells Fargo Autograph or Bank of America Travel Rewards.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Best by Category -->
      <div id="best-categories">

        <p>Access to both Capital One Lounges and Priority Pass network, plus $300 in travel credits and 10,000 anniversary miles, makes this the best premium card for lounge lovers.</p>

        <h3>🍽️ Best for Dining: American Express® Gold Card</h3>
        <p>With 4X at restaurants worldwide and $240 in annual dining/Uber credits, the Gold Card is unmatched for food lovers who travel.</p>

        <h3>💰 Best No Annual Fee: Wells Fargo Autograph℠</h3>
        <p>Earning 3X on travel, dining, gas stations, and transit with no annual fee makes this the best free travel card available.</p>
