// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is the best travel credit card for 2025?",
    answer: "The <strong>Chase Sapphire Preferred®</strong> is widely considered the best overall travel card for 2025. It offers a 75,000-point welcome bonus (worth $937+ when transferred to Hyatt), excellent 5X/3X earning rates, and valuable transfer partners including United, Southwest, Hyatt, and Marriott. The $95 annual fee is easily justified by the benefits."
  },
  {
    question: "How do travel credit card points work?",
    answer: "Travel cards earn points or miles on purchases. <strong>Flexible points</strong> (Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou) can transfer to 10-20+ airline/hotel partners or be redeemed for any travel. <strong>Co-branded points</strong> (Delta SkyMiles, Hilton Honors) are redeemable only with that brand but include perks like free bags or elite status. Points are typically worth 1-2 cents each."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a $550+ annual fee worth it for a travel card?",
    answer: "For frequent travelers, yes. The Chase Sapphire Reserve ($550) includes a $300 travel credit and Priority Pass lounges—if you visit 4 lounges and use the credit, you've already exceeded the fee. The effective cost is only $250. Similarly, Capital One Venture X ($395) with its $300 credit and 10K anniversary miles has an effective cost near $0."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need for a travel rewards card?",
    answer: "Most travel rewards cards require <strong>good to excellent credit (700+ FICO)</strong>. Premium cards like Amex Platinum or Chase Sapphire Reserve typically require 750+. No-annual-fee options like Wells Fargo Autograph may approve scores in the 670-700 range. Check your credit score for free before applying."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get an airline card or a general travel card?",
    answer: "It depends on loyalty. <strong>Airline cards</strong> (Delta, United) offer perks like free bags and boarding but lock you to one airline. <strong>Flexible cards</strong> (Chase Sapphire, Capital One Venture) let you transfer to multiple airlines for the best deals. If you fly one airline 80%+ of the time, get their card. Otherwise, choose flexibility."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between points and miles?",
    answer: "Nothing meaningful—they're different names for reward currency. 'Miles' is used by airlines and Capital One; 'points' by Chase, Amex, and Citi. Both are worth approximately 1-2 cents each depending on redemption. The value comes from <em>how</em> you redeem, not what they're called."
  },
  {
    question: "Do travel credit cards charge foreign transaction fees?",
    answer: "<strong>Premium travel cards never charge foreign transaction fees</strong> (typically 3% elsewhere). All 15 cards on this page have $0 foreign transaction fees—a must-have for international travel. Always verify before applying, and avoid using non-travel cards abroad."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I maximize travel credit card rewards?",
    answer: "<strong>1)</strong> Use the right card for each category (dining card at restaurants). <strong>2)</strong> Transfer points to airline partners for premium cabins—often worth 2-5¢ each. <strong>3)</strong> Never carry a balance; interest destroys rewards value. <strong>4)</strong> Stack credits (Global Entry, travel credits, dining credits). <strong>5)</strong> Time big purchases around welcome bonus requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Which card has the best airport lounge access?",
    answer: "The <strong>Amex Platinum ($695)</strong> offers the best lounges via Centurion Lounge access—full-service bars, hot food, and spa services. For value, the <strong>Capital One Venture X ($395)</strong> includes both Capital One Lounges and Priority Pass Select at a lower fee. Chase Sapphire Reserve includes Priority Pass only."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I have multiple travel credit cards?",
    answer: "Yes! Many travel hackers carry 3-5 cards strategically: one for dining (Amex Gold), one for travel (Chase Sapphire Reserve), one for flights (airline card), etc. Each issuer has rules—Chase's 5/24 limits new accounts, Amex has lifetime welcome bonus restrictions. Research before applying for multiple cards."

        <!-- How Travel Rewards Work -->
        <div id="how-rewards-work" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>How Travel Credit Card Rewards Work</h2>
          
          <p>Travel credit cards earn <strong>points or miles</strong> on every purchase you make. The value of these rewards typically ranges from <strong>1 to 2 cents per point</strong>, depending on how you redeem them. Understanding the fundamentals helps you maximize every dollar spent.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> Points vs. Miles: What's the Difference?</h4>
            <p>"Points" and "miles" are essentially the same thing—reward currency with different names. Chase and Amex use "points," while airlines and Capital One use "miles." Both are worth approximately 1-2 cents each depending on redemption. Don't let terminology confuse you.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Two Types of Travel Cards</h3>
          
          <p><strong>General-Purpose Travel Cards</strong> (Chase Sapphire, Capital One Venture, Amex Gold) earn flexible points that can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Transfer to 10-20+ airline and hotel partners at 1:1 ratio</li>
            <li>Be redeemed for any travel purchase as statement credit</li>
            <li>Book travel through the issuer's portal at fixed values</li>
            <li>Convert to cash back (usually at lower value)</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Co-Branded Airline/Hotel Cards</strong> (Delta SkyMiles, Hilton Honors, United MileagePlus) earn loyalty points redeemable only with that brand, but include valuable perks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Free checked bags (worth $70+ per roundtrip)</li>
            <li>Priority boarding and upgrade eligibility</li>
            <li>Elite status credits and accelerated earning</li>
            <li>Companion certificates and anniversary perks</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"/></svg> Key Insight</h4>
            <p>Most travel experts recommend starting with a <strong>flexible points card</strong> (like Chase Sapphire Preferred) before getting co-branded cards. Flexibility lets you shop for the best deals across airlines rather than being locked to one carrier.</p>

          <h3>Calculate Your Points Value</h3>
          <p>Use our interactive calculator to find out exactly how much your credit card points are worth:</p>

          <h2>How to Choose a Travel Credit Card</h2>

          <p>The best travel card depends on your travel habits, spending patterns, and how you value flexibility versus brand-specific perks. Ask yourself these questions:</p>

          <h3>Understanding Annual Fees</h3>

          <p>Don't let annual fees scare you away. Premium cards often provide significantly more value than their fee:</p>

            <h4>When to Avoid Annual Fee Cards</h4>
            <p>If you travel less than twice per year or won't use the credits and perks, stick with no-annual-fee options like the Wells Fargo Autograph or Bank of America Travel Rewards. Paying a fee you won't recoup defeats the purpose.</p>
