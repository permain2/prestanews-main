// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is the best cash back credit card for 2025?",
    answer: "The <strong>Blue Cash Preferred® from American Express</strong> is our top pick for 2025 if you spend heavily on groceries. The 6% back at U.S. supermarkets (up to $6K/year) plus 6% on streaming delivers unmatched value. For a no-annual-fee option, the <strong>Citi Double Cash®</strong> or <strong>Wells Fargo Active Cash®</strong> offer 2% on everything."
  },
  {
    question: "Is 2% cash back good?",
    answer: "Yes, <strong>2% flat-rate cash back is excellent</strong> for a no-annual-fee card. On $20,000 annual spending, that's $400 back. While category cards can earn more in specific areas (5-6%), you'd need to optimize spending and track categories. For simplicity and guaranteed returns, 2% is hard to beat."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get a flat-rate or category cash back card?",
    answer: "<strong>Category cards</strong> (like Blue Cash Preferred at 6% groceries) maximize returns if you can concentrate spending in bonus areas. <strong>Flat-rate cards</strong> (like Citi Double Cash at 2%) are better if your spending is varied or you don't want to track categories. Many people use both — category cards for specific purchases, flat-rate for everything else."
  },
  {
    question: "Do cash back cards have annual fees?",
    answer: "Many excellent cash back cards have <strong>no annual fee</strong>, including Citi Double Cash, Wells Fargo Active Cash, Discover it, and Chase Freedom cards. Premium cards like Blue Cash Preferred ($95/year) charge fees but often deliver enough extra rewards to offset the cost for high spenders."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I redeem cash back rewards?",
    answer: "Most cards offer multiple redemption options: <strong>statement credits</strong> (most common), <strong>direct deposit</strong> to bank accounts, <strong>check by mail</strong>, or <strong>gift cards</strong> (sometimes at bonus value). Statement credits and direct deposits typically offer the best value. Avoid redeeming for merchandise, which often gives worse value."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between cash back and points?",
    answer: "<strong>Cash back</strong> has a fixed value (1% = 1¢ per dollar). <strong>Points</strong> can vary in value (typically 1-2¢ each) depending on how you redeem them. Some 'cash back' cards like Chase Freedom actually earn points that can be transferred to travel partners for higher value when combined with cards like Sapphire Preferred."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I have multiple cash back cards?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many savvy consumers carry <strong>3-4 cash back cards</strong> strategically: one for groceries (Blue Cash Preferred), one for dining (SavorOne), one for gas/rotating categories (Freedom Flex), and a flat-rate backup (Citi Double Cash). This approach maximizes rewards across all spending."
  },
  {
    question: "Do cash back cards affect my credit score?",
    answer: "Like all credit cards, cash back cards can <strong>help or hurt your score</strong> depending on usage. Responsible use (paying on time, keeping utilization low) builds credit. Opening new cards causes temporary hard inquiries. Long-term, having multiple cards with good payment history improves your score."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need for cash back cards?",
    answer: "Premium cash back cards typically require <strong>good to excellent credit (700+ FICO)</strong>. No-annual-fee cards like Discover it or Capital One Quicksilver may approve scores in the <strong>650-700 range</strong>. Discover it is particularly known for approving those with limited credit history."
  },
  {
    question: "Is cash back taxable income?",
    answer: "Generally, <strong>no</strong>. The IRS treats credit card rewards as rebates on purchases rather than taxable income. However, sign-up bonuses that don't require spending (like some bank account bonuses) may be taxable. Cash back earned through normal card usage is not reported as income."

          <p>Cash back credit cards return a percentage of every purchase as rewards. Unlike travel points (which vary in value based on redemption), <strong>cash back has a fixed value: 1% = 1¢ per dollar spent</strong>. This simplicity makes cash back cards popular for everyday spending.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> Understanding Cash Back Rates</h4>
            <p>A "2% cash back" card returns $2 for every $100 spent. A card with "5% on groceries" returns $5 per $100 at grocery stores. These percentages compound quickly — spending $500/month on groceries at 5% earns $300/year in cash back.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Types of Cash Back Cards</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Flat-Rate Cash Back</strong> (like Citi Double Cash, Wells Fargo Active Cash):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Same rate (typically 1.5-2%) on ALL purchases</li>
            <li>No categories to track or activate</li>
            <li>Best for varied, unpredictable spending</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Category Cash Back</strong> (like Blue Cash Preferred, Freedom Flex):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Higher rates (3-6%) in specific categories</li>
            <li>Lower rate (1%) on non-bonus spending</li>
            <li>Best for concentrated spending in bonus areas</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Rotating Category Cash Back</strong> (like Discover it, Chase Freedom Flex):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>5% back in categories that change quarterly</li>
            <li>Requires quarterly activation</li>
            <li>Best for engaged cardholders who track promotions</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"/></svg> Maximize Your Cash Back</h4>
            <p>The most effective strategy is <strong>combining cards</strong>: use a category card for high-bonus spending (groceries, gas, dining) and a 2% flat-rate card for everything else. This approach typically earns 50-100% more than using a single card.</p>

          <h3>Annual Fee Considerations</h3>

          <p>Some cash back cards charge annual fees, but they can still deliver better value:</p>

          <div class="comparison-boxes">
            <div class="fee-breakdown">
              <h4>Blue Cash Preferred ($95/year)</h4>

                <li>3% on $1,200 gas = <strong>$36</strong></li>
                <li>Minus annual fee = <strong>-$95</strong></li>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>When to Choose No-Fee Cards</h4>
            <p>If you spend less than $3,200/year on groceries, the Blue Cash Everyday beats Blue Cash Preferred. Always calculate your expected rewards against the annual fee to determine the true winner for your spending.</p>
