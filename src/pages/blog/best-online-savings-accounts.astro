// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is a high-yield savings account?",
    answer: "A high-yield savings account (HYSA) pays <strong>10-12 times more interest</strong> than traditional bank savings accounts. While the national average savings rate is just 0.41% APY, the best high-yield accounts offer 4-5% APY. On a $10,000 balance, that's the difference between earning $41/year and $400+/year. These accounts are offered primarily by online banks with lower overhead costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Are online savings accounts safe?",
    answer: "Yes, online savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks are <strong>exactly as safe as traditional bank accounts</strong>. FDIC insurance protects your deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank. All banks on our list are FDIC insured. The only difference is the absence of physical branches—your money is protected identically to a brick-and-mortar bank."
  },
  {
    question: "How often is interest paid on savings accounts?",
    answer: "Most high-yield savings accounts <strong>compound interest daily and pay it monthly</strong>. Daily compounding means your interest earns interest every day, maximizing your returns. With a 4.75% APY compounded daily, $10,000 grows to $10,486.38 after one year—about $11 more than with monthly compounding."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between APY and interest rate?",
    answer: "<strong>APY (Annual Percentage Yield)</strong> is the true return on your money, including compound interest effects. The base interest rate doesn't account for compounding. For example, a 4.75% interest rate compounded daily yields 4.86% APY. Always compare APYs between accounts—it's the accurate measure of what you'll actually earn."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I lose money in a high-yield savings account?",
    answer: "You <strong>cannot lose your principal</strong> in an FDIC-insured savings account—your deposits are guaranteed. However, your <strong>purchasing power</strong> could decrease if inflation exceeds your interest rate. With current high-yield rates of 4-5% and inflation around 3%, you're likely gaining real purchasing power. During low-rate environments, savings may not keep pace with inflation."
  },
  {
    question: "How many savings accounts can I have?",
    answer: "There's <strong>no legal limit</strong> on savings accounts. Many savvy savers use multiple accounts strategically: one for emergency fund, one for vacation savings, one for a house down payment, etc. This 'bucket' approach helps organize goals. Some people also spread money across banks to maximize FDIC coverage ($250K limit per bank) or chase the highest rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to pay taxes on savings account interest?",
    answer: "Yes, <strong>interest earned is taxable income</strong>. Banks report interest over $10 annually to the IRS on Form 1099-INT. You'll receive this form in January and must report all interest earned on your tax return. At higher tax brackets, consider tax-advantaged options like I Bonds or municipal bond funds for some savings goals."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to savings rates when the Fed cuts rates?",
    answer: "High-yield savings rates typically <strong>decline when the Federal Reserve cuts rates</strong>, though not immediately or proportionally. Banks adjust gradually. After the Fed's 2024 rate cuts, top savings rates fell from 5.5% to 4.5-5%. If you want to lock in current rates, consider <strong>certificates of deposit (CDs)</strong> which guarantee your rate for the term length."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth switching banks for a higher APY?",
    answer: "It depends on the difference and your balance. On $10,000, the difference between 4.00% APY and 4.75% APY is <strong>$75/year</strong>. Worth switching? Probably. For larger balances, the math is compelling: on $50,000, that's $375/year. Most online bank switches take 15-30 minutes to open an account and initiate transfers. If the rate difference exceeds 0.5%, switching usually makes sense."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I keep all my savings in a high-yield account?",
    answer: "High-yield savings is ideal for <strong>emergency funds and short-term goals</strong> (1-3 years). For longer-term goals (5+ years), you may earn more in diversified investments despite higher risk. A common approach: 3-6 months of expenses in high-yield savings for emergencies, additional savings for 1-3 year goals, then invest the rest for long-term growth."

          <h2>How High-Yield Savings Accounts Work</h2>
          
          <p>High-yield savings accounts function identically to traditional savings accounts—but pay <strong>10-12 times more interest</strong>. While the national average savings rate is just 0.41% APY, top online banks offer 4-5% APY. The difference is substantial.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> Why Online Banks Pay More</h4>
            <p>Online banks have dramatically lower overhead—no physical branches, less staff, reduced real estate costs. They pass these savings directly to customers through higher APYs. There's no catch; it's simply a more efficient business model.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>The Power of Compound Interest</h3>
          
          <p>High-yield accounts typically compound interest <strong>daily</strong> and pay monthly. This means your interest earns interest every single day, maximizing your returns:</p>

            <h4>Watch Out for Rate Chasers</h4>
            <p>Constantly switching banks for the highest rate isn't always worth it. If you're earning 4.50% and another bank offers 4.75%, on $10,000 that's only $25/year difference. Factor in the hassle before switching. We recommend switching when the rate difference exceeds 0.50% or your bank consistently underperforms.</p>
