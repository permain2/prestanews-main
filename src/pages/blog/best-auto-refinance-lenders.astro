const faqs = [
  {
    question: "When should I refinance my car loan?",
    answer: "Consider refinancing when rates have dropped since your original loan, your credit score has improved significantly (50+ points), you're paying over 7-8% interest, or you want to lower monthly payments. Avoid refinancing if you're close to paying off the loan or your car is worth less than you owe."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save by refinancing my car?",
    answer: "Savings depend on rate reduction and remaining loan balance. A 2% rate reduction on a $20,000 balance over 48 months saves approximately $850 in interest. Use refinance calculators to estimate your specific savings based on your current terms."
  },
  {
    question: "Does refinancing hurt my credit score?",
    answer: "Refinancing causes a temporary small dip (5-10 points) from the hard credit inquiry. However, this typically recovers within a few months. Multiple loan applications within 14-45 days count as a single inquiry for scoring purposes, so rate shop within this window."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I refinance with negative equity?",
    answer: "Some lenders refinance up to 125% loan-to-value (LTV), meaning you can owe more than the car is worth. However, rates will be higher, and you'll still owe the full amount. Consider whether refinancing makes sense if you're significantly underwater."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does auto refinancing take?",
    answer: "The process typically takes 1-3 weeks from application to completion. Online lenders may fund in as little as 2-3 days. The timeline includes application, approval, payoff of old loan, and title transfer."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents do I need to refinance?",
    answer: "Typically required: driver's license, proof of income (pay stubs or tax returns), proof of insurance, vehicle registration, current loan account information, and proof of residence. Some lenders require odometer verification."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I skip a payment when refinancing?",
    answer: "Yes, refinancing often allows you to 'skip' your next payment since you're essentially paying off the old loan. However, interest continues accruing. It's usually best to continue payments until the new loan is fully processed."

## Is Auto Refinancing Right for You?

Refinancing your car loan can save hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest—but it's not right for everyone. Understanding when refinancing makes sense helps you make the best financial decision.

### Good Candidates for Refinancing

- **Credit score improved** 50+ points since original loan
- **Current rate above 7%** and market rates are lower
- **Loan is less than halfway paid** (significant principal remaining)
- **Car value exceeds loan balance** (positive equity)
- **No prepayment penalty** on current loan

### When to Skip Refinancing

- Less than $5,000 remaining on loan
- Current rate already competitive (under 5%)
- Significant negative equity without improvement
- Very old vehicle (many lenders won't refinance)
- Planning to sell car within 12 months

## How Auto Refinancing Works

### Step 1: Check Your Current Loan

Review your current loan terms:
- Remaining balance
- Interest rate
- Monthly payment
- Months remaining
- Payoff amount (may differ from balance)
- Prepayment penalties (rare but check)

### Step 2: Check Your Credit

Your credit score significantly impacts available rates:

| Credit Score | Typical Rate Range |
|--------------|-------------------|
| 720+ | 5.0% - 7.0% |
| 660-719 | 7.0% - 10.0% |
| 600-659 | 10.0% - 15.0% |
| Below 600 | 15.0%+ |

### Step 3: Get Multiple Quotes

Apply to several lenders within a 14-day window—multiple inquiries count as one for credit scoring. Compare:
- Interest rate (APR)
- Loan term options
- Fees (origination, title, etc.)
- Payment amount

### Step 4: Choose and Apply

Select the best offer and complete the application. The new lender will:
1. Verify your information
2. Appraise vehicle value
3. Pay off your existing loan
4. Issue new loan documents
5. Handle title transfer

## Calculating Your Savings

### Break-Even Analysis

Compare total costs of keeping current loan vs refinancing:

**Example:**
- Current loan: $18,000 at 9% with 48 months remaining
- New loan: $18,000 at 6% for 48 months
- Monthly savings: $27
- Total interest savings: $1,296
- Refinancing costs: $0 (most auto refinancing is free)
- **Net savings: $1,296**

### Monthly Payment vs Total Cost

Extending your loan term lowers monthly payments but may cost more overall:

| Scenario | Monthly Payment | Total Interest |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Current: 48 mo @ 9% | $448 | $3,504 |
| New: 48 mo @ 6% | $423 | $2,304 |
| New: 60 mo @ 6% | $348 | $2,880 |
| New: 72 mo @ 6% | $299 | $3,528 |

**Tip:** Refinance to a lower rate with the same or shorter term to maximize savings.

## What Lenders Look At

### Vehicle Requirements

Most lenders have restrictions:
- **Age:** Under 7-10 years old (credit unions more flexible)
- **Mileage:** Under 100,000-125,000 miles
- **Value:** Must exceed loan amount (ideally)
- **Title:** Clear, in your name

### Borrower Requirements

- Proof of income (employment or self-employment)
- Valid driver's license
- Full coverage auto insurance
- Proof of residence
- Good payment history (ideally)

## Credit Union vs Bank vs Online Lender

| Factor | Credit Union | Bank | Online Lender |
|--------|-------------|------|---------------|
| Rates | Typically lowest | Moderate | Competitive |
| Speed | Slower | Moderate | Fastest |
| Flexibility | Most flexible | Rigid | Varies |
| Service | Personal | Varies | Digital |
| Requirements | Membership | May require relationship | Open |

## Tips for Getting the Best Rate

### Before Applying

1. **Check credit reports** for errors (dispute if found)
2. **Pay down credit cards** below 30% utilization
3. **Avoid new credit** applications for 30+ days
4. **Gather documents** (income, insurance, current loan info)

### During Application

1. **Apply to 3-5 lenders** within 14 days
2. **Compare APR** not just interest rate
3. **Ask about fees** (most should be $0)
4. **Negotiate** if you have competing offers

## The Bottom Line

For most borrowers, **Auto Approve** or **myAutoloan** offer the easiest way to compare multiple lender offers. Those with excellent credit should check **LightStream** for potentially the lowest rates.

Credit unions like **PenFed** and **Consumers Credit Union** often beat banks and online lenders, especially for older vehicles or challenging situations.

*Rates shown are examples for well-qualified borrowers. Your actual rate depends on credit, income, vehicle, and other factors.*
