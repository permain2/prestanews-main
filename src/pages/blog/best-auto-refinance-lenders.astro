  {
    question: "When should I refinance my car loan?",
    answer: "Consider refinancing when <strong>rates have dropped</strong> since your original loan, your <strong>credit score has improved</strong> significantly (50+ points), you're paying <strong>over 7-8% interest</strong>, or you want to lower monthly payments. Avoid refinancing if you're close to paying off the loan (less than $5,000 remaining) or your car is worth less than you owe without a plan to address the gap."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save by refinancing my car?",
    answer: "Savings depend on rate reduction and remaining loan balance. A <strong>2% rate reduction</strong> on a $20,000 balance over 48 months saves approximately <strong>$850 in interest</strong>. The average borrower saves $1,847 over their loan term. Use refinance calculators to estimate your specific savings based on your current terms."
  },
  {
    question: "Does refinancing hurt my credit score?",
    answer: "Refinancing causes a <strong>temporary small dip (5-10 points)</strong> from the hard credit inquiry. However, this typically recovers within a few months. Multiple loan applications within <strong>14-45 days count as a single inquiry</strong> for scoring purposes, so rate shop within this window to minimize impact."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I refinance with negative equity?",
    answer: "Some lenders (like PenFed) refinance up to <strong>125% loan-to-value (LTV)</strong>, meaning you can owe more than the car is worth. However, rates will be higher, and you'll still owe the full amount. Consider whether refinancing makes sense if you're significantly underwater—sometimes paying down the balance first is smarter."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does auto refinancing take?",
    answer: "The process typically takes <strong>1-3 weeks</strong> from application to completion. Online lenders like LightStream may fund in as little as <strong>2-3 days</strong>. The timeline includes application review, approval, payoff of your old loan, and title transfer to the new lender."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents do I need to refinance?",
    answer: "Typically required: <strong>driver's license</strong>, <strong>proof of income</strong> (pay stubs or tax returns), <strong>proof of auto insurance</strong>, <strong>vehicle registration</strong>, <strong>current loan account information</strong> (payoff amount), and <strong>proof of residence</strong>. Some lenders require odometer verification or photos of the vehicle."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I skip a payment when refinancing?",
    answer: "Yes, refinancing often allows you to <strong>'skip' your next payment</strong> since you're essentially paying off the old loan. However, interest continues accruing on your new loan. It's usually best to continue payments on your old loan until the new loan is fully processed and confirmed."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need to refinance?",
    answer: "Requirements vary by lender. Most competitive rates require <strong>720+ credit scores</strong>. Lenders like myAutoloan and RateGenius work with scores as low as <strong>550-580</strong>. Expect to pay higher rates with lower scores: 720+ gets 5-7%, 660-719 gets 7-10%, and below 660 may see 10%+."

        <h2 id="how-it-works">Is Auto Refinancing Right for You?</h2>
        
        <p>Refinancing your car loan can save hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest—but it's not right for everyone. Understanding when refinancing makes sense helps you make the best financial decision.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M9 12l2 2 4-4m6 2a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/></svg> Good Candidates for Refinancing</h4>
          <ul class="mt-3 space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>• Credit score improved 50+ points since original loan</li>
            <li>• Current rate above 7% and market rates are lower</li>
            <li>• Loan is less than halfway paid (significant principal remaining)</li>
            <li>• Car value exceeds loan balance (positive equity)</li>
            <li>• No prepayment penalty on current loan</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
          <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M12 9v2m0 4h.01m-6.938 4h13.856c1.54 0 2.502-1.667 1.732-3L13.732 4c-.77-1.333-2.694-1.333-3.464 0L3.34 16c-.77 1.333.192 3 1.732 3z" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/></svg> When to Skip Refinancing</h4>
          <p>Less than $5,000 remaining on loan, current rate already competitive (under 5%), significant negative equity without improvement, very old vehicle (many lenders won't refinance), or planning to sell car within 12 months.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How Auto Refinancing Works</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Check Your Current Loan</h3>
        <p>Review your current loan terms: remaining balance, interest rate, monthly payment, months remaining, payoff amount (may differ from balance), and prepayment penalties (rare but check).</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Check Your Credit</h3>
        <p>Your credit score significantly impacts available rates:</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Credit Score</th>
              <th>Typical Rate Range</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>720+</td>
              <td>5.0% - 7.0%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>660-719</td>
              <td>7.0% - 10.0%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>600-659</td>
              <td>10.0% - 15.0%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Below 600</td>
              <td>15.0%+</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Step 3: Get Multiple Quotes</h3>
        <p>Apply to several lenders within a <strong>14-day window</strong>—multiple inquiries count as one for credit scoring. Compare: interest rate (APR), loan term options, fees (origination, title, etc.), and payment amount.</p>

        <h2>Calculating Your Savings</h2>

          <p>Refinance to a lower rate with the <strong>same or shorter term</strong> to maximize savings. Extending your term lowers monthly payments but may cost more overall in interest.</p>
