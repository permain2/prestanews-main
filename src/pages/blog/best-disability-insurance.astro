// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is disability insurance?",
    answer: "Disability insurance replaces a portion of your income (typically <strong>60-70%</strong>) if you become unable to work due to illness or injury. It protects your most valuable asset—your ability to earn income—ensuring you can pay bills and maintain your lifestyle during recovery. Think of it as paycheck protection for when you can't work."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between short-term and long-term disability?",
    answer: "<strong>Short-term disability</strong> covers temporary disabilities for 3-6 months with shorter elimination periods (1-14 days). <strong>Long-term disability</strong> covers extended disabilities for years or until retirement age, with elimination periods of 90-180 days. Most financial experts recommend prioritizing long-term coverage since short-term needs can often be covered by an emergency fund."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'own-occupation' mean?",
    answer: "<strong>Own-occupation</strong> disability insurance pays benefits if you can't perform your specific job, even if you could work in another field. A surgeon who can no longer operate but could teach gets full benefits. <strong>Any-occupation</strong> policies only pay if you can't work ANY job suited to your education—much harder to qualify. Own-occupation is essential for specialists and high earners."
  },
  {
    question: "How much disability insurance do I need?",
    answer: "Most experts recommend coverage equal to <strong>60-70% of your gross income</strong>. You typically can't insure more than this because insurers want you to have incentive to return to work. Calculate your monthly expenses, account for employer coverage, and ensure you can maintain your lifestyle. If your employer pays premiums, benefits are taxable—factor this into coverage amounts."
  },
  {
    question: "What is an elimination period?",
    answer: "The <strong>elimination period</strong> is the waiting time between becoming disabled and when benefits begin—essentially a deductible measured in time. Common periods are 30, 60, 90, or 180 days. <strong>Longer elimination periods = lower premiums</strong> but require more savings to cover the gap. Most people choose 90 days as a balance between cost and coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "Is disability insurance tax deductible?",
    answer: "If you pay premiums with <strong>after-tax dollars personally</strong>, your benefits are tax-free. If your employer pays premiums or you use pre-tax dollars, benefits are taxable. This is critical: a $5,000/month benefit that's taxable is really only $3,500 after taxes. Pay with after-tax dollars for tax-free benefits when you need them most."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get disability insurance with pre-existing conditions?",
    answer: "Yes, but pre-existing conditions may be <strong>excluded from coverage</strong> (you won't get benefits for that condition) or result in higher premiums. Many insurers will cover you after a condition has been stable for 12-24 months. <strong>Apply sooner rather than later</strong>—every year you wait risks developing new conditions that affect coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose between Northwestern Mutual, Guardian, and MassMutual?",
    answer: "<strong>Northwestern Mutual</strong> is best for maximum coverage and customization. <strong>Guardian Life</strong> excels for physicians and high-earning specialists with their ProVider Plus policy. <strong>MassMutual</strong> offers unique lifetime own-occupation coverage. All three have A++ ratings—get quotes from each and compare policy language carefully."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I buy individual disability insurance if I have employer coverage?",
    answer: "<strong>Yes, in most cases.</strong> Employer group coverage typically has limitations: any-occupation definitions, 60% salary caps, taxable benefits, and it ends when you leave. Individual policies are portable, often offer own-occupation protection, and provide tax-free benefits if you pay premiums. Supplement group coverage with individual insurance for complete protection."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best disability insurance for doctors and physicians?",
    answer: "Physicians should prioritize <strong>Guardian Life</strong> or <strong>Northwestern Mutual</strong> for their true own-occupation specialty-specific coverage. A surgeon who can't operate but could do consultations still gets full benefits. Look for policies that define disability by your specific medical specialty, not just 'physician.' The extra cost is worth it for $300K+ earners."

        <!-- Why Disability Insurance Matters -->
        <div id="how-rewards-work" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>Why Disability Insurance Matters</h2>
          
          <p>Your ability to earn income is likely your most valuable financial asset. A 35-year-old earning $75,000 annually will earn over <strong>$2.25 million</strong> before retirement. Disability insurance protects this earning potential when illness or injury prevents you from working.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> The Statistics Are Sobering</h4>
            <p><strong>1 in 4 workers</strong> will experience a disability lasting 90+ days before age 67. The average long-term disability lasts 2.5 years. Only 48% of American adults have disability coverage beyond Social Security—which denies 65% of initial applications.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Types of Disability Insurance</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Individual Disability Insurance</strong> (what we recommend) offers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Coverage stays with you if you change jobs</li>
            <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Choose your benefit amount, elimination period, and riders</li>
            <li><strong>Own-occupation protection:</strong> Available on most individual policies</li>
            <li><strong>Non-cancellable guarantees:</strong> Premiums and benefits locked in</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Group/Employer Disability Insurance</strong> typically offers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lower cost (employer may pay part or all premiums)</li>
            <li>Guaranteed issue (no medical underwriting required)</li>
            <li>Limited benefits (often caps at 60% of salary with monthly maximums)</li>
            <li>Not portable (coverage ends when employment ends)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"/></svg> Key Insight</h4>
            <p>Even if you have employer coverage, you likely need individual disability insurance. Group policies are typically any-occupation (much harder to qualify), taxable if employer-paid, and disappear when you leave your job. <strong>Supplement group coverage with individual insurance for complete protection.</strong></p>

          <h2>How Much Does Disability Insurance Cost?</h2>

          <p>Disability insurance typically costs <strong>1-3% of your annual income</strong>. For a $100,000 earner, expect to pay $1,000-$3,000 per year ($83-$250/month) for comprehensive coverage.</p>
