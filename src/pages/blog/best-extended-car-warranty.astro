// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Which extended car warranty company has the best reputation?",
    answer: "<strong>CARCHEX</strong> consistently ranks highest in customer satisfaction with a 4.2/5 star rating and 94% claim approval rate. Their comprehensive coverage options, nationwide repair network of 25,000+ facilities, and A+ BBB rating make them the most trusted provider in the industry."
  },
  {
    question: "Are extended car warranties worth the money?",
    answer: "Extended warranties provide value when <strong>annual repair costs exceed the warranty's annual cost</strong>. Vehicles with average repair costs above $1,500 annually benefit most. Luxury vehicles and European imports show the highest ROI - a single BMW transmission repair ($4,000-$8,000) can cover years of warranty payments."
  },
  {
    question: "What does the best extended car warranty cover?",
    answer: "The most comprehensive <strong>exclusionary (bumper-to-bumper) warranties</strong> cover all vehicle components except specific exclusions like maintenance items (oil, filters), wear items (brake pads, tires), and pre-existing conditions. Top plans include engine, transmission, electrical systems, A/C, advanced electronics, and 24/7 roadside assistance."
  },
  {
    question: "How much should I pay for an extended car warranty?",
    answer: "Extended warranty costs should not exceed <strong>15-20% of your vehicle's current value annually</strong>. For a $20,000 vehicle, aim for $3,000-$4,000 maximum per year. Average costs: Powertrain ($1,200-$2,400/year), Stated Component ($1,800-$3,200/year), Comprehensive ($2,800-$4,500/year)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I buy an extended car warranty after my factory warranty expires?",
    answer: "Yes, most providers allow purchases within <strong>30-90 days after factory warranty expiration</strong>. Some providers like CarShield and Route 66 cover vehicles regardless of factory warranty status. Tip: Purchasing sooner often qualifies you for better rates and avoids inspection requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best extended warranty for high-mileage cars?",
    answer: "<strong>CarShield</strong> leads for high-mileage coverage, accepting vehicles up to 300,000 miles and 20 years old. Route 66 also specializes in older vehicles (up to 25 years). Both understand aging vehicle systems and cover components other providers exclude for high-mileage cars."
  },
  {
    question: "Do extended car warranties cover pre-existing problems?",
    answer: "<strong>No</strong> - all extended warranties exclude pre-existing conditions. Most require <strong>30-90 day waiting periods</strong> before coverage begins. Some providers require vehicle inspections to identify existing issues. This is why purchasing coverage before problems develop is important."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between an extended warranty and a service contract?",
    answer: "Legally, <strong>true extended warranties</strong> come only from manufacturers. What most companies sell are <strong>vehicle service contracts (VSCs)</strong> - third-party agreements to cover repairs. VSCs are regulated by state insurance departments, while manufacturer warranties fall under federal warranty law. The coverage can be identical, but the legal protections differ."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use any mechanic with an extended warranty?",
    answer: "Most extended warranties let you use <strong>any licensed repair facility</strong>, though some require ASE-certified mechanics. A few providers (like Olive) let you choose any shop. Check your contract - using unauthorized facilities could void coverage. For luxury vehicles, dealer service is often recommended."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I file a claim with an extended car warranty?",
    answer: "When your car breaks down: <strong>1)</strong> Call your warranty company's claims hotline before repairs begin. <strong>2)</strong> Take your vehicle to an approved repair facility. <strong>3)</strong> The shop diagnoses the issue and contacts the warranty company. <strong>4)</strong> Once approved, the warranty company pays the shop directly (minus your deductible). Most claims are approved within 24-48 hours."

        <!-- What Is an Extended Car Warranty -->
        <div id="what-is" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>What Is an Extended Car Warranty?</h2>
          
          <p>An extended car warranty (technically called a <strong>vehicle service contract</strong>) provides coverage for mechanical breakdowns after your manufacturer's warranty expires. Unlike traditional insurance, these contracts cover specific vehicle components and systems—protecting you from unexpected repair bills that can reach thousands of dollars.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> Factory Warranty vs. Extended Warranty</h4>
            <p><strong>Factory warranties</strong> come from manufacturers and cover defects in materials or workmanship. <strong>Extended warranties</strong> are third-party contracts that cover mechanical failures from normal wear and tear. Most factory warranties last 3-5 years or 36,000-60,000 miles—extended coverage picks up where they leave off.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Three Types of Coverage</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Powertrain Coverage</strong> ($1,200-$2,400/year):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Covers engine, transmission, and drivetrain components</li>
            <li>Most affordable option—protects against the most expensive repairs</li>
            <li>Best for reliable vehicle brands with good track records</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Stated Component Coverage</strong> ($1,800-$3,200/year):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lists specific covered components (A/C, electrical, suspension)</li>
            <li>Mid-level protection at moderate costs</li>
            <li>Most popular choice for average consumers</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Exclusionary (Bumper-to-Bumper) Coverage</strong> ($2,800-$4,500/year):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Covers everything EXCEPT specifically listed exclusions</li>
            <li>Most comprehensive protection available</li>
            <li>Best value for luxury vehicles and unreliable brands</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"/></svg> Key Insight</h4>
            <p>With over 40% of vehicles experiencing major mechanical issues after their factory warranty expires, extended coverage has become increasingly valuable. A single transmission replacement ($3,000-$5,000) can exceed years of warranty payments.</p>

          <h3>5 Questions to Ask Before Buying</h3>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>What's the claim approval rate?</strong> Look for 90%+ approval rates. Anything below 85% is a red flag.</li>
            <li><strong>Can I use any repair shop?</strong> Most plans allow ASE-certified mechanics. Some restrict to specific networks.</li>
            <li><strong>What's the deductible structure?</strong> Per-visit vs. per-repair deductibles significantly impact costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Is there a waiting period?</strong> Most plans have 30-90 day waiting periods before coverage begins.</li>
            <li><strong>Is the warranty transferable?</strong> Transferable warranties increase your vehicle's resale value.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Red Flags to Avoid</h4>
            <p><strong>Never buy from providers who:</strong> Use high-pressure sales tactics, refuse to provide contract terms before purchase, claim "final notice" via robocalls, advertise unrealistically low prices (comprehensive coverage under $50/month is not legitimate), or have BBB ratings below B.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Cost Breakdown -->
        <div id="cost-breakdown" class="scroll-mt-24">
          <h2>Extended Car Warranty Cost Breakdown</h2>

          <p>Understanding pricing helps you avoid overpaying. Costs vary based on coverage level, vehicle age, and mileage:</p>

          <div class="comparison-boxes">
            <div class="fee-breakdown">
              <h4>Vehicle Age Impact</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Under 3 years: <strong>Base pricing</strong></li>
                <li>3-6 years: <strong>15-25% premium</strong></li>
                <li>6-10 years: <strong>40-60% premium</strong></li>
                <li>Over 10 years: <strong>75-100%+ premium</strong></li>

              <ul>
                <li>Under 60,000 miles: <strong>Standard rates</strong></li>
                <li>60,000-100,000 miles: <strong>20-30% increase</strong></li>
                <li>Over 100,000 miles: <strong>50-75% increase</strong></li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Money-Saving Tips</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Choose higher deductibles:</strong> Increasing from $100 to $250 can reduce premiums 15-25%</li>
            <li><strong>Pay annually:</strong> Monthly payments often include 10-15% financing charges</li>
            <li><strong>Negotiate:</strong> Published rates often include 50-100% dealer markups—independent agents offer better pricing</li>
            <li><strong>Buy early:</strong> Purchase within 30 days of vehicle acquisition to avoid inspections and get better rates</li>
            <li><strong>Consider powertrain-only:</strong> For reliable brands (Toyota, Honda), basic coverage may be sufficient</li>
