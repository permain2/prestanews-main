const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Do I need a subscription for security cameras?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. Cameras from <strong>Eufy, Reolink, and Wyze</strong> offer free local storage options with full functionality. However, cloud storage subscriptions typically provide longer video history (30-60 days), AI-powered detection, and easier remote access. Calculate your 3-year total cost—sometimes higher upfront camera cost beats monthly fees."
  },
  {
    question: "What resolution should I choose?",
    answer: "<strong>1080p (Full HD)</strong> is sufficient for most home security needs—it captures faces clearly at typical distances. <strong>2K and 4K</strong> provide more detail for identifying license plates or monitoring large areas but require more storage and bandwidth. 4K matters most for driveways and large properties."
  },
  {
    question: "Wireless vs wired cameras: which is better?",
    answer: "<strong>Wireless cameras</strong> offer easy installation and flexible placement—great for renters. <strong>Wired (PoE) cameras</strong> provide reliable power, consistent connectivity, and no battery maintenance—better for permanent installations. For critical areas like front doors, wired often provides better long-term reliability."
  },
  {
    question: "How much storage do security cameras need?",
    answer: "Continuous recording uses <strong>10-20GB per camera per day</strong> at 1080p. Motion-activated recording uses much less—typically 2-5GB daily. For local NVR systems, plan for 1TB per camera for 1-2 weeks of retention. Cloud plans typically offer 30-60 days of history."
  },
  {
    question: "Can security cameras work without internet?",
    answer: "Cameras with <strong>local storage</strong> (SD card or NVR) can record without internet. However, you won't receive mobile alerts or access footage remotely. Some cameras like Reolink offer local network viewing during internet outages. For reliability, consider cameras with both cloud and local storage options."
  },
  {
    question: "Are outdoor cameras weatherproof?",
    answer: "Look for <strong>IP65 or IP67 ratings</strong> for outdoor use. IP65 protects against rain and dust. IP67 can handle temporary submersion. Also check operating temperature ranges—some cameras struggle below 0°F or above 104°F. All cameras in our top picks are rated for outdoor use."
  },
  {
    question: "Do security cameras deter crime?",
    answer: "Studies show visible cameras <strong>deter property crime by 13-50%</strong>. For maximum deterrent effect, position cameras visibly at entry points with clear signage. Cameras with spotlights (Ring, Arlo, Blink) provide additional deterrent. However, cameras work best as part of a complete security strategy including lighting and locks."
  },
  {
    question: "Which cameras work with my smart home?",
    answer: "<strong>Amazon Alexa:</strong> Ring, Blink, Wyze, Arlo work best. <strong>Google Home:</strong> Nest is seamless; Wyze and Arlo also work. <strong>Apple HomeKit:</strong> Eufy and Logitech offer HomeKit Secure Video with local processing. Check compatibility before buying if smart home integration matters to you."
