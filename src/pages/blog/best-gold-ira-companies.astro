  {
    question: "What is a gold IRA?",
    answer: "A gold IRA is a <strong>self-directed individual retirement account</strong> that holds physical precious metals (gold, silver, platinum, palladium) instead of paper assets. It offers the same tax advantages as traditional IRAs—tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (Roth)—while providing diversification into tangible assets that historically hold value during economic uncertainty."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of gold can I hold in an IRA?",
    answer: "IRS rules require gold to be at least <strong>99.5% pure</strong> (0.995 fineness). Eligible products include: American Gold Eagles, American Gold Buffalos, Canadian Gold Maple Leafs, Austrian Philharmonics, and gold bars from COMEX/NYMEX approved refiners. Collectible coins, rare coins, and jewelry are <strong>not allowed</strong>."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I transfer my 401(k) or IRA to a gold IRA?",
    answer: "You can rollover existing retirement funds to a gold IRA <strong>without tax penalties</strong> through a direct rollover (funds transfer directly between custodians) or indirect rollover (you receive funds and redeposit within 60 days). Your gold IRA company handles the process: opening your self-directed IRA, contacting your current custodian, and coordinating the transfer."
  },
  {
    question: "Where is gold IRA metal stored?",
    answer: "IRS regulations require gold IRA metals to be stored in an <strong>approved depository</strong>—you cannot store them at home (this would be considered a distribution and trigger taxes). Popular depositories include Delaware Depository, Brink's, and IDS. You can choose segregated storage (your specific coins) or allocated storage (fungible metals)."
  },
  {
    question: "What fees are involved in a gold IRA?",
    answer: "Typical fees include: <strong>setup fee</strong> ($0-$300, often waived), <strong>annual custodian fee</strong> ($50-$150), <strong>annual storage fee</strong> ($100-$300), and transaction fees when buying/selling. Total annual costs typically run $175-$300/year. Always get a complete fee schedule before investing—reputable companies are transparent about costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I take physical possession of my gold IRA metals?",
    answer: "You can take physical possession only as a <strong>distribution</strong>, which triggers taxes (and 10% penalty if under 59½). An 'in-kind' distribution transfers the actual metals to you rather than selling for cash. Many investors take distributions after retirement when they're in a lower tax bracket."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the risks of gold IRAs?",
    answer: "Key risks include: <strong>price volatility</strong> (gold prices fluctuate daily), <strong>higher fees</strong> reducing returns compared to traditional IRAs, <strong>liquidity concerns</strong> (selling physical gold takes 2-5 days), <strong>no dividends</strong> or interest income, and potential <strong>dealer markups</strong>. Gold works best as portfolio diversification (5-15%), not a primary investment."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a gold IRA right for me?",
    answer: "<strong>Consider a gold IRA if:</strong> you want to diversify retirement savings, you're concerned about inflation or currency devaluation, you have a long investment horizon, and you understand precious metals volatility. <strong>Skip if:</strong> you have limited retirement savings, need maximum growth potential, want income-producing investments, or are uncomfortable with higher fees."

        <p>A gold IRA allows you to hold physical precious metals in a tax-advantaged retirement account. As economic uncertainty persists and inflation concerns grow, gold IRAs have become increasingly popular for portfolio diversification.</p>

          <ul class="mt-3 space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>• <strong>Inflation hedge:</strong> Gold historically maintains purchasing power during inflationary periods</li>

            <li>• <strong>Tangible asset:</strong> Physical ownership of real metal</li>
            <li>• <strong>Tax advantages:</strong> Same benefits as traditional/Roth IRAs</li>

        <h2>How Gold IRAs Work</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Choose a Gold IRA Company</h3>
        <p>Select a reputable dealer who will help establish your self-directed IRA, guide you through the rollover process, assist with metal selection, and coordinate with the custodian and depository.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Open a Self-Directed IRA</h3>
        <p>Your gold IRA company partners with a custodian (like Equity Trust or GoldStar) who holds your account, processes transactions, handles IRS reporting, and maintains compliance.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Fund Your Account</h3>
        <p>Transfer funds via <strong>direct rollover</strong> (401(k) or IRA transferred directly—no tax impact), <strong>indirect rollover</strong> (you receive funds, must deposit within 60 days), or <strong>annual contributions</strong> up to IRS limits.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Purchase Metals</h3>
        <p>Work with your dealer to select IRS-approved metals. Purchases are made through your custodian and shipped directly to the depository.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>For most investors, <strong>Augusta Precious Metals</strong> offers the best combination of education and service, though their $50,000 minimum limits accessibility. <strong>Goldco</strong> provides excellent all-around service with a lower $25,000 entry point.</p>
        
        <p>First-time precious metals investors should consider <strong>Noble Gold</strong> for their industry-low $2,000 minimum, while those with larger portfolios may benefit from Augusta's white-glove service.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-[#68727C] italic mt-6">Gold prices fluctuate and past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Consult a financial advisor before making retirement investment decisions.</p>
