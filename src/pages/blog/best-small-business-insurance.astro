  <h3>Professional Liability Insurance</h3>
  <p>Also known as errors and omissions (E&O) insurance, professional liability coverage protects against claims of professional negligence, mistakes, or failure to deliver promised services.</p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h4>💡 Who Needs Professional Liability?</h4>
    <p>Consultants, lawyers, accountants, healthcare providers, technology companies, and any business providing professional advice or expertise should carry professional liability insurance.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Workers' Compensation Insurance</h3>
  <p>Workers' compensation provides medical benefits and wage replacement for employees injured while performing job duties. Most states legally require this coverage for businesses with employees.</p>

  <div class="warning-box">
    <h4>⚠️ Legal Requirement</h4>
    <p>Workers' compensation is mandatory in <strong>49 states</strong> (Texas being the exception). Penalties for non-compliance include fines up to $10,000 and potential criminal charges.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>How to Choose the Right Small Business Insurance</h2>

  <h3>Assess Your Risk Profile</h3>
  <p>Begin by conducting a comprehensive risk assessment of your business operations. Consider factors like industry type, business size, number of employees, customer interaction levels, and physical assets.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>High-Risk Industries:</strong> Construction, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation</li>
    <li><strong>Medium-Risk Industries:</strong> Retail, restaurants, professional services</li>
    <li><strong>Low-Risk Industries:</strong> Consulting, software development, accounting</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Determine Required Coverage Types</h3>
  <p>Most small businesses need a combination of coverage types to address various risk exposures:</p>

  <p><strong>Essential Coverage (90% of businesses need):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>General liability insurance</li>
    <li>Commercial property insurance (if you own business property)</li>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>Industry-Specific Coverage:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Professional liability for service businesses</li>
    <li>Product liability for manufacturers</li>
    <li>Commercial auto for delivery/transportation</li>
    <li>Cyber liability for businesses handling sensitive data</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Consider Bundling Opportunities</h3>

  <h2>Small Business Insurance Cost: What to Expect</h2>

        <td>$89-$167</td>
        <td>$78-$134</td>
        <td>$356-$623/mo</td>
      </tr>

    <li><strong>Security Systems:</strong> Burglar alarms, cameras, and fire suppression systems lower property insurance rates</li>
    <li><strong>Higher Deductibles:</strong> Increasing deductibles from $500 to $2,500 can reduce premiums by 15-25%</li>
    <li><strong>Claims Prevention:</strong> Maintaining claim-free periods qualifies businesses for experience-based discounts</li>
  </ul>
