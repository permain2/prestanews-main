const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What type of insurance does a small business need?",
    answer: "Most small businesses need <strong>general liability insurance</strong> as a foundation. If you have employees, workers' compensation is legally required in 49 states. Professional service businesses should add professional liability (E&O) coverage, while businesses with physical assets need commercial property insurance. A Business Owner's Policy (BOP) bundles general liability and property coverage at discounted rates."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does small business insurance cost?",
    answer: "Small business insurance costs range from <strong>$35-$200 monthly</strong> for basic coverage, with most businesses paying $89-$167 monthly for comprehensive protection. Low-risk service businesses (consulting, software) typically pay $35-$67 monthly, while high-risk industries like construction may pay $200-$400 monthly. Factors affecting cost include industry, location, revenue, and number of employees."
  },
  {
    question: "Is small business insurance required by law?",
    answer: "<strong>Workers' compensation</strong> insurance is legally required in 49 states for businesses with employees (Texas is the exception). <strong>Commercial auto insurance</strong> is mandatory for business-owned vehicles. While general liability isn't legally required, most commercial leases, contracts, and clients require minimum coverage of $1 million per occurrence."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between general liability and professional liability?",
    answer: "<strong>General liability</strong> covers third-party bodily injury, property damage, and personal injury claims arising from your business operations—like a customer slipping in your store. <strong>Professional liability</strong> (E&O) protects against claims of professional negligence, errors, or failure to deliver promised services—like a consultant giving bad advice that costs a client money. Most service businesses need both."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get small business insurance online?",
    answer: "Yes, many carriers offer <strong>online quotes and policy purchase</strong> for standard business types. Progressive, Next Insurance, and GEICO Business provide fully digital experiences with instant binding. However, complex businesses, unique coverage needs, or high-risk industries often require agent assistance for proper coverage evaluation."
  },
  {
    question: "What does general liability insurance cover for small business?",
    answer: "General liability covers: <strong>1)</strong> Third-party bodily injury (customer injuries on your premises), <strong>2)</strong> Property damage caused by your business operations, <strong>3)</strong> Personal and advertising injury (libel, slander, copyright infringement), <strong>4)</strong> Medical payments for minor injuries, <strong>5)</strong> Legal defense costs. It does NOT cover professional errors, employee injuries, or your own business property."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I file a small business insurance claim?",
    answer: "Contact your insurance carrier <strong>immediately</strong> after an incident—most provide 24/7 claim reporting hotlines. Document the scene with photos, gather witness information, and preserve any damaged property. File your claim through the carrier's app, website, or by phone. Most claims are reviewed within 48-72 hours and resolved within 30-60 days."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the most affordable small business insurance option?",
    answer: "<strong>GEICO Business and Next Insurance</strong> offer the lowest average premiums starting at $27-$29 monthly for basic coverage. However, the cheapest option isn't always the best value—consider coverage adequacy, carrier financial strength (AM Best rating), and customer service quality. A Business Owner's Policy (BOP) often provides better value by bundling coverages at 15-25% savings."
