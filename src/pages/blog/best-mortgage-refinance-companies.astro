const faqs = [
  {
    question: "When does refinancing make sense?",
    answer: "Refinancing typically makes sense when you can <strong>lower your rate by at least 0.5-1%</strong>, which can save hundreds per month. Also consider refinancing to switch from an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to fixed-rate, to remove PMI if you've built 20% equity, to shorten your loan term, or to access cash through a cash-out refinance. Calculate your break-even point: if closing costs are $6,000 and you save $200/month, break-even is 30 months."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does mortgage refinancing cost?",
    answer: "Refinancing typically costs <strong>2-5% of the loan amount</strong> in closing costs. For a $300,000 loan, expect $6,000-$15,000. Costs include: origination fees (0-1%), appraisal ($300-$600), title insurance ($500-$1,500), and various other fees. Some lenders like Better Mortgage offer $0 lender fees, and many offer no-closing-cost options where fees are rolled into the loan or offset by a higher rate."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need to refinance?",
    answer: "Most conventional refinances require a <strong>minimum 620 credit score</strong>, though you'll need 700+ for the best rates. FHA streamline refinances may accept lower scores. Your credit score significantly impacts your rate: 760+ gets the best rates, 700-759 is good, 660-699 is fair, and below 660 will face higher rates or may not qualify. Check your score before applying and consider improving it if borderline."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does refinancing take?",
    answer: "Refinancing typically takes <strong>30-45 days</strong> from application to closing. Some lenders like Better Mortgage can close in 21 days, while banks like Chase may take 45+ days. Factors affecting timeline include: appraisal scheduling, document collection, underwriting queue, and title search. Streamline refinances (FHA/VA) can be faster since they require less documentation."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I do a cash-out refinance?",
    answer: "Cash-out refinancing lets you borrow against your home equity, but it <strong>increases your mortgage balance</strong> and resets your loan term. It can make sense for home improvements (which add value), consolidating high-interest debt, or funding major expenses. Avoid cash-out refinancing for discretionary spending or if it significantly increases your monthly payment. Compare rates to home equity loans/HELOCs as alternatives."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between rate-and-term vs cash-out refinance?",
    answer: "<strong>Rate-and-term refinancing</strong> replaces your current mortgage with a new one at a different rate and/or term—you don't take equity out. <strong>Cash-out refinancing</strong> lets you borrow more than you owe, receiving the difference in cash. Rate-and-term typically offers better rates (0.125-0.25% lower) and lower closing costs. Cash-out has stricter requirements and higher rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I refinance with negative equity?",
    answer: "Standard refinancing requires <strong>positive equity</strong>, but options exist for underwater homeowners. HARP (Home Affordable Refinance Program) ended, but some lenders offer similar programs. FHA and VA streamline refinances don't require appraisals, bypassing the equity question. If significantly underwater, focus on paying down principal before attempting to refinance."
  },
  {
    question: "Is now a good time to refinance?",
    answer: "With rates around <strong>6-7% in late 2025</strong>, refinancing makes sense if your current rate is above 7%, you have an ARM nearing adjustment, or you want to switch from FHA to conventional (eliminating PMI). While rates are higher than 2020-2021 historic lows, the Fed's rate cuts suggest further decreases ahead. Consider locking if your situation warrants refinancing now."

        <p>With mortgage rates hovering around <strong>6-7% in late 2025</strong>, refinancing makes sense for specific situations. While rates are higher than the historic lows of 2020-2021, the Fed's ongoing rate cuts suggest further decreases ahead.</p>

          <ul class="mt-3 space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>• Homeowners with rates <strong>above 7%</strong></li>
            <li>• Those with <strong>adjustable-rate mortgages</strong> nearing adjustment</li>
            <li>• Borrowers who want to <strong>switch from FHA to conventional</strong> (eliminating PMI)</li>
            <li>• Those needing <strong>cash out</strong> for home improvements or debt consolidation</li>
            <li>• Homeowners wanting to <strong>shorten their loan term</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Types of Mortgage Refinance</h2>

        <h3>Rate-and-Term Refinance</h3>
        <p>Replaces your current mortgage with a new one at a different rate and/or term. Best for lowering your interest rate, switching from ARM to fixed-rate, or changing loan length (30-year to 15-year).</p>

        <h3>Cash-Out Refinance</h3>
        <p>Borrow more than you owe, receiving the difference in cash. Best for home improvements (can increase home value), debt consolidation, or major expenses. Rates are typically 0.125-0.25% higher than rate-and-term.</p>

        <h3>Streamline Refinance</h3>
        <p>Simplified refinance for existing FHA, VA, or USDA loans with minimal documentation. Best for quick rate reduction without appraisals—VA IRRRL and FHA Streamline are the most common.</p>

          <p><strong>Break-Even = Closing Costs ÷ Monthly Savings</strong><br/>
          Example: $6,000 closing costs ÷ $200 monthly savings = 30 months (2.5 years). If you plan to stay longer, refinancing likely makes sense.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How to Get the Best Refinance Rate</h2>

        <h3>Improve Your Financial Profile</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Boost credit score:</strong> Pay down debt, correct errors, avoid new credit applications</li>
          <li><strong>Lower DTI ratio:</strong> Pay off debts or document additional income</li>
          <li><strong>Build equity:</strong> Higher equity = better rates and no PMI (at 20%)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Shop Multiple Lenders</h3>
        <p>Rate differences between lenders can be significant—up to 0.5% for the same borrower profile. Within a <strong>14-45 day window</strong>, multiple credit inquiries for mortgages count as one inquiry on your credit report. Always compare APR (includes fees), closing costs, lender credits, and lock period terms.</p>

          <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M12 9v2m0 4h.01m-6.938 4h13.856c1.54 0 2.502-1.667 1.732-3L13.732 4c-.77-1.333-2.694-1.333-3.464 0L3.34 16c-.77 1.333.192 3 1.732 3z" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/></svg> Watch Out for No-Closing-Cost Offers</h4>
          <p>No-closing-cost refinances roll fees into the loan or offset them with a higher rate. This makes sense if you plan to move within 3-5 years or need to preserve cash. Otherwise, paying closing costs upfront usually saves more long-term.</p>
