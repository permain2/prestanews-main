  {
    question: "When does refinancing make sense?",
    answer: "Refinancing typically makes sense when you can lower your rate by at least 0.5-1%, you plan to stay in your home long enough to recoup closing costs (usually 2-4 years), or you want to change loan terms. Use the break-even calculation: closing costs ÷ monthly savings = months to break even."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does mortgage refinancing cost?",
    answer: "Refinancing typically costs 2-5% of the loan amount in closing costs ($4,000-$10,000 on a $200,000 loan). Costs include appraisal ($300-$600), title insurance ($500-$1,500), origination fees (0-1%), and other closing costs. Some lenders offer no-closing-cost options with slightly higher rates."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need to refinance?",
    answer: "Most conventional refinances require a 620+ credit score, with the best rates available at 740+. FHA refinances may accept scores as low as 580. VA refinances often have flexible credit requirements. Higher scores qualify for lower rates and better terms."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does refinancing take?",
    answer: "The typical refinance takes 30-45 days from application to closing. Streamlined refinances (FHA, VA, USDA) may close faster. Delays can occur with appraisal issues, title problems, or high lender volume. Some online lenders offer closings in as little as 3 weeks."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I do a cash-out refinance?",
    answer: "Cash-out refinancing lets you borrow against home equity, but increases your loan balance and payments. It makes sense for high-interest debt consolidation, home improvements, or investments. Avoid using home equity for depreciating purchases or discretionary spending."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between rate-and-term vs cash-out refinance?",
    answer: "Rate-and-term refinancing changes your interest rate and/or loan term without borrowing additional funds. Cash-out refinancing replaces your loan with a larger one, giving you the difference in cash. Cash-out refinances typically have higher rates and stricter requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I refinance with negative equity?",
    answer: "Refinancing underwater mortgages is difficult but possible through government programs. FHA Streamline and VA IRRRL programs allow refinancing regardless of equity. Some lenders offer underwater refinance options for borrowers with excellent payment history."

## Is Now a Good Time to Refinance?

With mortgage rates hovering around 6-7% in late 2025, refinancing makes sense for homeowners with rates above 7% or those looking to switch loan types. While rates are higher than historic lows, they're expected to trend lower as the Fed continues easing.

### Who Should Consider Refinancing Now

- Homeowners with rates **above 7%**
- Those with **adjustable-rate mortgages** nearing adjustment
- Borrowers who want to **switch from FHA to conventional** (eliminating PMI)
- Those needing **cash out** for home improvements or debt consolidation
- Homeowners wanting to **shorten their loan term**

## Types of Mortgage Refinance

### Rate-and-Term Refinance

Replaces your current mortgage with a new one at different rate and/or term. Best for:
- Lowering your interest rate
- Switching from ARM to fixed-rate
- Changing loan length (30-year to 15-year)

### Cash-Out Refinance

Borrow more than you owe, receiving the difference in cash. Best for:
- Home improvements (can increase home value)
- Debt consolidation (pay off high-interest debt)
- Major expenses (education, medical)

### Streamline Refinance

Simplified refinance for existing FHA, VA, or USDA loans with minimal documentation. Best for:
- Quick rate reduction
- Borrowers who don't want appraisals
- Those with lower credit scores

## Understanding Refinance Costs

| Cost Type | Typical Range | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Origination Fee | 0-1% of loan | Some lenders waive this |
| Appraisal | $300-$600 | May be waived for some loans |
| Title Insurance | $500-$1,500 | Required on all refinances |
| Recording Fees | $50-$250 | Government fees |
| Credit Report | $25-$50 | Per applicant |
| Discount Points | 0-3% of loan | Optional - buys down rate |

### No-Closing-Cost Refinance

Many lenders offer no-closing-cost options where fees are rolled into the loan or offset by a higher rate. This makes sense if:
- You plan to move within 3-5 years
- You don't have cash for closing costs
- You want to preserve liquidity

## How to Get the Best Refinance Rate

### Improve Your Financial Profile

- **Boost credit score:** Pay down debt, correct errors, avoid new credit
- **Lower DTI ratio:** Pay off debts or increase income documentation
- **Build equity:** Higher equity = better rates and no PMI

### Shop Multiple Lenders

Rate differences between lenders can be significant. Within a 14-45 day window, multiple credit inquiries for mortgages count as one inquiry on your credit report.

**Always compare:**
- Interest rates (APR includes fees)
- Closing costs itemized
- Lender credits offered
- Lock period terms

### Consider Discount Points

Paying points (1 point = 1% of loan amount) lowers your rate. Points make sense if:
- You'll stay in the home long-term
- You have excess cash at closing
- The rate reduction is significant

## Break-Even Analysis

Calculate how long until your savings exceed closing costs:

**Break-Even = Closing Costs ÷ Monthly Savings**

Example:
- Closing costs: $6,000
- Monthly savings: $200
- Break-even: 30 months (2.5 years)

If you plan to stay in your home longer than the break-even point, refinancing likely makes financial sense.

## Documents You'll Need

Gather these before applying:
- Two years of tax returns
- Recent pay stubs (30 days)
- Two months of bank statements
- W-2s or 1099s (two years)
- Homeowners insurance declarations
- Current mortgage statement
- Photo ID

## The Bottom Line

For the best online refinance experience, **Rocket Mortgage** leads with their digital platform. **Better Mortgage** offers the lowest fees with no lender charges. **Veterans United** is the clear choice for VA-eligible borrowers.

Those wanting to compare multiple lenders easily should use **Credible** to see competitive rates from several companies with one application.
