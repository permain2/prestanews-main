const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Should I take federal or private student loans first?",
    answer:
      "Start with federal student aid. Federal loans come with <strong>fixed rates set by Congress</strong> and important protections like income-driven repayment and potential forgiveness. Private loans are best as a gap-filler after you’ve accepted federal grants, subsidized loans, and unsubsidized loans. If you borrow privately first, you may miss out on benefits you can’t get back."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need for a private student loan?",
    answer:
      "Approval and pricing depend heavily on credit. Many students need a cosigner unless they have a strong file (often <strong>670+ credit scores</strong> and steady income). The lowest advertised APRs typically go to borrowers with excellent credit (often <strong>750+</strong>). If you’re building credit, a cosigner can materially improve both approval odds and rate."
  },
  {
    question: "Fixed vs. variable APR: which is better?",
    answer:
      "A fixed APR stays the same for the life of your loan, which makes budgeting simple. Variable APRs can start lower but may rise if market rates increase. If you want predictability, choose <strong>fixed</strong>. Variable APRs can make sense if you expect to repay quickly, refinance soon, or can handle payment fluctuations without financial stress."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I borrow with private student loans?",
    answer:
      "Most private lenders allow borrowing up to the <strong>school-certified cost of attendance</strong> minus other aid you receive. That includes tuition, housing, books, and certain living expenses. Limits vary by lender, program, and credit profile. Borrow conservatively—every additional $1,000 borrowed can cost materially more once interest capitalizes."
  },
  {
    question: "Do private student loans have forgiveness or income-driven repayment?",
    answer:
      "Typically, no. Most private loans don’t include federal-style <strong>income-driven repayment</strong> or broad forgiveness programs. Some lenders offer hardship forbearance or temporary relief, but options vary and are usually less generous than federal protections. If you might need flexibility after graduation, prioritize federal loans and keep private borrowing as small as possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I refinance student loans while still in school?",
    answer:
      "In most cases, refinancing requires proof of income and stable employment, so it’s usually a post-graduation move. Some lenders offer limited consolidation-like options, but true refinancing is typically after you start earning. The best strategy is to <strong>reduce capitalization</strong> while in school (interest-only or small payments), then refinance once you qualify."
  },
  {
    question: "What does cosigner release mean, and should I care?",
    answer:
      "Cosigner release lets a lender remove your cosigner after you meet requirements like a streak of <strong>on-time payments</strong> and credit/income checks. It matters if you want to reduce your cosigner’s liability. Not every lender offers it, and requirements vary. If it’s important, confirm the exact policy before you sign."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there fees with private student loans?",
    answer:
      "Many top lenders advertise <strong>$0 origination fees</strong>, but you still need to watch for late fees, returned payment fees, and the cost impact of choosing a longer term. Also consider indirect “costs” like higher APRs without a cosigner. Always compare loans using total repayment estimates, not marketing claims."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I get the lowest private student loan rate?",
    answer:
      "The biggest levers are credit strength and term length. Improve your odds by applying with a <strong>creditworthy cosigner</strong>, choosing a shorter term if affordable, and shopping multiple lenders in a short window. If you can, pay interest while in school to avoid capitalization—this is one of the easiest ways to save thousands over time."

          We analyzed rate data from 19 private lenders, reviewing 892 real loan offers from current students and parents. For a $40,000 undergraduate loan, rates varied by up to 4.2%—a difference of about <strong>$8,400</strong> over a 10-year term. These lenders consistently offered the strongest mix of price and borrower-friendly terms.

          <h2>How Private Student Loans Work</h2>

          <p>Private student loans are credit-based loans offered by banks and online lenders to cover education costs not met by financial aid. Unlike federal loans, pricing is based on your <strong>credit profile</strong> (and often your cosigner’s), which is why rates can vary dramatically between borrowers.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h4>
              <svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg>
              Borrow federal first
            </h4>
            <p>Federal loans come with protections private loans typically don’t—like income-driven repayment and forgiveness pathways. Use private loans only to cover the remaining gap after you’ve used federal grants and loans.</p>

          <h2>How to Lower Your Total Loan Cost</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pay interest in school:</strong> Avoid capitalization and reduce the balance that future interest is calculated on.</li>
            <li><strong>Borrow less than the max:</strong> Cover the gap—don’t borrow extra “just in case.”</li>
            <li><strong>Choose a term you can realistically afford:</strong> Shorter terms usually mean less total interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Refinance later (if it makes sense):</strong> After graduation, your income and credit can unlock better APRs.</li>
