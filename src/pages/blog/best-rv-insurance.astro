    rating: 4.7,
    monthlyRange: "$125-$250",
    amBest: "A+",
    coverage: "Comprehensive",
    pros: ["Full-timer coverage actually designed for living in your RV", "Total loss replacement on newer rigs", "Roadside assistance that understands RVs need specialized towing", "24/7 claims support that won't leave you stranded"],
    cons: ["Premiums run higher than recreational-only policies", "Deductibles can add up on comprehensive claims", "Claims process occasionally slower than competitors"],
    description: "If your RV is your home—not just a weekend toy—Progressive is the only major insurer that truly gets it. Their full-timer policies cover liability for your RV as a residence, not just a vehicle.",
    bottomLine: "Progressive wrote the book on full-time RV insurance. While most insurers treat RVs like oversized cars, Progressive understands that a Class A motorhome is someone's home. Their full-timer coverage includes personal property protection, vacation liability, and medical payments for guests—coverage you simply won't find elsewhere. Worth the premium if you're living the lifestyle.",
    details: [
      "Full-timer policies for RV-as-primary-residence",
      "Total loss replacement within first 5 years",

    rating: 4.6,
    monthlyRange: "$100-$200",
    amBest: "A (through partners)",
    coverage: "RV-Specialized",
    pros: ["They literally only do RV insurance—nobody knows the market better", "Replacement cost coverage without depreciation games", "Good Sam membership perks (roadside, camping discounts)", "Staff who actually understand RV terminology"],
    cons: ["Best rates require Good Sam membership ($29/year)", "Underwritten through partner carriers", "Limited physical agent network"],
    description: "Good Sam has been serving RVers since the 1960s. When you call, you talk to people who know the difference between a fifth wheel and a travel trailer—and that matters when you're filing a claim.",
    bottomLine: "Good Sam Insurance makes sense for dedicated RVers who want specialists, not generalists. Their agents speak RV fluently, and claims don't require explaining what a slideout is. The membership requirement ($29/year) pays for itself with camping discounts anyway. If you already have Good Sam roadside, bundling insurance is a no-brainer.",

    cons: ["Customer service reviews are mixed", "Fewer RV-specific features than specialists", "Full-timer coverage limited"],
    description: "If you use your RV a few weekends a year and want basic protection without paying full-timer prices, National General delivers solid coverage at the lowest rates we found.",
    bottomLine: "National General is the smart choice for weekend warriors. If your RV sits in storage most of the year and you just need protection for those camping trips, why pay full-timer premiums? Their recreational policies cover what matters—liability, collision, comprehensive—without the bells and whistles that drive up costs.",

    cons: ["Rates higher for older/custom units", "Agent-only quotes (no online)", "Limited availability in some states"],
    description: "Got a vintage Winnebago or a custom-built skoolie? Foremost specializes in the RVs that make other insurers nervous. They understand that a restored Airstream is worth more than book value.",
    bottomLine: "Foremost is where you go when everyone else says no. Vintage rigs, custom conversions, high-value builds—Foremost has seen it all. Their agreed value coverage means you won't get lowballed when you've invested $50,000 into a 30-year-old trailer. The agent-only process is annoying, but for specialty RVs, they're worth the call.",

    cons: ["Agent-only sales (no direct)", "Full-timer options limited", "Availability varies by state"],
    description: "If you already have auto and home insurance, Safeco's bundle discounts can make RV coverage surprisingly affordable. They're underwritten by Liberty Mutual, so claims actually get paid.",
    bottomLine: "Safeco makes financial sense when you're already bundling. Their multi-policy discounts (10-25% off) can drop RV insurance costs below standalone specialists. The Liberty Mutual backing is reassuring for claims, and agreed value coverage protects your investment. Just don't expect RV-specialist knowledge from their agents.",

    bottomLine: "GEICO is straightforward RV insurance for recreational users who want reliability over specialization. Their A++ AM Best rating (highest possible) means claims get paid, period. Military and government workers get additional discounts that can drop premiums 15%+. Just don't expect full-timer coverage or RV-specialist knowledge.",

    bottomLine: "Roamly is for RVers who hate insurance bureaucracy. No agents, no phone calls, no nonsense—just get a quote online, buy a policy, and manage everything through their app. They're newer, so the long-term track record isn't there yet, but their RVer-centric approach and transparent pricing are refreshing.",

// FAQ data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What does RV insurance actually cover?",
    answer: "RV insurance covers liability (if you cause an accident), collision (damage from crashes), comprehensive (theft, weather, vandalism), personal belongings inside, and often roadside assistance. Full-timer policies add coverage for your RV as a residence—liability for guests, higher personal property limits, and loss-of-use coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I really need specialized RV insurance?",
    answer: "Yes. Standard auto insurance doesn't properly cover RVs. RVs have unique risks—higher values, living quarters, specialized components—that auto policies don't address. Even a travel trailer needs its own policy, not just whatever your tow vehicle has."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between full-timer and recreational coverage?",
    answer: "Recreational policies cover RVs you use occasionally for trips. Full-timer policies treat your RV as your primary residence, adding coverage for personal belongings (like renters insurance), liability for guests visiting your 'home,' and higher property limits. If you live in your RV more than 6 months/year, you need full-timer coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does RV insurance cost?",
    answer: "Recreational RV insurance runs $500-$2,000/year depending on RV type and value. Full-timer policies cost $1,500-$4,000/year. Class A motorhomes cost more to insure than travel trailers. Location, driving history, and coverage levels also affect premiums significantly."
  },
  {
    question: "What's 'agreed value' vs 'actual cash value'?",
    answer: "Actual cash value pays what your RV is worth today (with depreciation). Agreed value pays a predetermined amount you and the insurer agree on when you buy the policy. For newer or well-maintained RVs, agreed value protects your investment better—you know exactly what you'll get if it's totaled."
  },
  {
    question: "Does my auto insurance cover my RV at all?",
    answer: "Your auto insurance might cover liability while towing a trailer, but it won't cover the RV itself. Motorhomes definitely need their own policy. Even towable RVs need separate coverage for comprehensive, collision, and contents. Never assume your auto policy is enough."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I insure my RV if I rent it out?",
    answer: "Standard RV policies exclude commercial use, including rentals. If you rent through Outdoorsy or RVShare, their platform insurance covers rentals, but verify the limits. For frequent rentals, you'll need a commercial RV policy or the rental platform's insurance add-ons."

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-[#4B5563]">
        <p class="mb-4">RV insurance protects your investment against accidents, theft, weather damage, and liability claims. Unlike auto insurance, RV policies must account for your vehicle's dual nature as both transportation and living space.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The type of RV dramatically affects your insurance needs. A $400,000 Class A diesel pusher needs different coverage than a $15,000 travel trailer. And if you're living in your RV full-time, you need coverage that treats it as your home.</p>
        <p>Don't assume your auto insurance covers your RV. It doesn't—not adequately, anyway. RVs need specialized policies that understand the unique risks involved.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-[#1E40AF] mb-2">Full-Timer vs. Recreational</h3>
          <p>If you live in your RV more than 6 months/year, you need full-timer coverage. It adds liability for your RV as a residence, higher personal property limits, and loss-of-use coverage if your home gets damaged.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-[#F8FAFC] p-6 rounded-xl">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-[#162433] mb-2">Agreed Value vs. Actual Cash Value</h3>
          <p>Agreed value pays a predetermined amount if your RV is totaled. Actual cash value deducts depreciation. For newer or custom RVs, agreed value protects your investment—you won't get lowballed when you've invested serious money.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-[#F8FAFC] p-6 rounded-xl">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-[#162433] mb-2">Consider Your RV Type</h3>
          <p>Class A motorhomes cost more to insure than travel trailers. Fifth wheels cost more than pop-ups. Make sure your policy covers the actual replacement cost of your specific RV type.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-[#162433] mb-2">Check Roadside Assistance Details</h3>
          <p>RVs need specialized towing—not every tow truck can handle a 40-foot motorhome. Make sure roadside assistance includes heavy-duty towing and RV-specific services.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">We obtained quotes from every major RV insurer for three vehicle types: a 2023 Class A motorhome ($150,000 value), a 2022 travel trailer ($35,000 value), and a 2021 fifth wheel ($55,000 value). We got quotes in 8 states to account for regional pricing differences.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Our rankings consider:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Coverage Quality (35%):</strong> What's actually covered, exclusions, limits</li>
