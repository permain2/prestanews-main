  {
    question: "How much does it cost to ship a car?",
    answer: "Car shipping costs range from $500 to $1,500+ depending on distance, vehicle type, and transport method. Average costs are roughly $1 per mile for short distances, $0.75 per mile for medium distances, and $0.50 per mile for cross-country moves. Enclosed transport adds 40-60% to open carrier prices."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does auto transport take?",
    answer: "Typical transit times: Coast-to-coast takes 7-10 days, regional transport (500-1,000 miles) takes 3-5 days, and local moves under 500 miles take 1-3 days. Add 1-5 days for carrier pickup scheduling. Expedited service is available at additional cost."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my car insured during transport?",
    answer: "Yes, all legitimate carriers must have cargo insurance (minimum $750,000). However, coverage varies and may have deductibles. Review the carrier's insurance certificate before shipping and consider gap coverage from the broker. Document your car's condition with photos before pickup."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I choose open or enclosed transport?",
    answer: "Open transport is the standard, cost-effective option suitable for most vehicles. Enclosed transport costs 40-60% more but protects vehicles from weather and road debris—recommended for luxury cars, classics, exotics, or vehicles worth over $70,000."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do to prepare my car for shipping?",
    answer: "Remove personal items (not covered by insurance), disable toll transponders, leave only 1/4 tank of gas, note existing damage with photos, disable alarms, and ensure the car is operable. Keep one set of keys for pickup and provide another to the carrier."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I put belongings in my car during transport?",
    answer: "While some carriers allow up to 100 lbs of items in the trunk, personal belongings aren't covered by carrier insurance. Most carriers prohibit items for liability reasons. It's best to ship belongings separately or through a moving company."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my car is damaged during transport?",
    answer: "Inspect your vehicle thoroughly at delivery and note any damage on the Bill of Lading before signing. Take photos and file a claim with the carrier's insurance immediately. Reputable brokers like Sherpa and Montway offer additional protection and claims assistance."

## How Car Transport Works

Auto transport companies act as brokers connecting you with carriers who physically move vehicles. Understanding this process helps you choose wisely and avoid common pitfalls.

### The Auto Transport Process

1. **Get quotes** from multiple brokers (instant online or phone)
2. **Book your shipment** with deposit and pickup window
3. **Carrier assigned** to your route (1-7 days typically)
4. **Pickup scheduled** within your window
5. **Vehicle inspected** and loaded (photos taken)
6. **Transit** with tracking updates
7. **Delivery inspection** and final payment

## Cost Factors Explained

| Factor | Impact on Price |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Distance** | $0.50-$1.00 per mile |
| **Vehicle Size** | SUVs/trucks +$100-$200 |
| **Transport Type** | Enclosed +40-60% |
| **Time of Year** | Summer/winter peaks +15-25% |
| **Route Popularity** | Rural pickup +$100-$300 |
| **Timeline** | Expedited +$200-$500 |
| **Vehicle Condition** | Non-running +$150-$300 |

### Sample Pricing by Route

| Route | Open Transport | Enclosed |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| LA to NYC (2,800 mi) | $1,100-$1,500 | $1,700-$2,200 |
| Miami to Chicago (1,400 mi) | $750-$1,000 | $1,100-$1,500 |
| Seattle to Denver (1,300 mi) | $700-$950 | $1,050-$1,400 |
| Dallas to Atlanta (800 mi) | $500-$700 | $750-$1,000 |
| Boston to DC (450 mi) | $400-$550 | $600-$800 |

## Open vs Enclosed Transport

### Open Transport (Standard)

**Best for:** Most vehicles, including daily drivers, newer cars in good condition, and vehicles under $70,000 value.

**Pros:**
- Most cost-effective option
- Faster carrier availability
- Standard industry practice

**Cons:**
- Exposed to weather and road debris
- Visible during transport
- Minor cosmetic risks possible

### Enclosed Transport (Premium)

**Best for:** Luxury vehicles, classics, exotics, show cars, and vehicles over $70,000.

**Pros:**
- Complete protection from elements
- Higher insurance coverage
- Privacy during transport
- Climate-controlled options available

**Cons:**
- 40-60% premium cost
- Fewer carriers available
- Longer scheduling times

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Warning Signs of Unreliable Companies

- **Extremely low quotes** (if it seems too good to be true, it is)
- **Large upfront deposits** (reputable companies charge little or nothing upfront)
- **No physical address** or verifiable business information
- **Pressure to book immediately** without time to compare
- **Unlicensed or uninsured** carriers (verify DOT and MC numbers)
- **No written contract** or vague terms
- **Poor reviews** or no reviews at all

### Verify Before Booking

1. Check broker's **FMCSA registration** at safer.fmcsa.dot.gov
2. Review **BBB rating** and complaints
3. Read **customer reviews** on multiple platforms
4. Confirm **insurance coverage** amounts
5. Get **written quote** with all terms

## How to Get the Best Price

### Timing Strategies

- **Book 2-4 weeks ahead** for best rates
- **Avoid peak seasons** (January, June-August)
- **Flexible pickup dates** can save 10-20%
- **Mid-month shipping** often cheaper than month-end

### Negotiation Tips

- Get quotes from **3-5 companies** minimum
- Ask about **price matching** policies
- Inquire about **military, student, or senior discounts**
- Consider **open dates** for lower pricing
- Bundle **multiple vehicles** for discounts

## Special Shipping Situations

### Non-Running Vehicles

Inoperable vehicles require a winch or forklift for loading, adding $150-$300. Inform your broker upfront—misrepresenting vehicle condition causes pickup delays.

### Oversized Vehicles

Lifted trucks, duallies, and vehicles over 7 feet tall may need specialized carriers and incur additional fees of $100-$500.

### Snowbird Routes

Florida to/from Northeast routes are extremely popular. Prices spike in fall (southbound) and spring (northbound). Book 3-4 weeks ahead during peak snowbird season.

## The Bottom Line

For most vehicle shipments, **Montway Auto Transport** offers the best combination of price, service, and carrier network. **Sherpa Auto Transport** is ideal for customers wanting guaranteed pricing with no surprises.

Budget-conscious shippers should consider **uShip** or **Bargain Auto Transport** if comfortable managing carrier selection. Luxury vehicle owners benefit from **Easy Auto Ship's** specialized premium service.
