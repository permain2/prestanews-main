const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to ship a car?",
    answer: "Car shipping costs range from <strong>$500 to $1,500+</strong> depending on distance, vehicle type, and transport method. Average costs are roughly $1 per mile for short distances, $0.75 per mile for medium distances, and $0.50 per mile for cross-country moves. Enclosed transport adds 40-60% to open carrier prices."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does auto transport take?",
    answer: "Typical transit times: <strong>Coast-to-coast takes 7-10 days</strong>, regional transport (500-1,000 miles) takes 3-5 days, and local moves under 500 miles take 1-3 days. Add 1-5 days for carrier pickup scheduling. Expedited service is available at additional cost."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my car insured during transport?",
    answer: "Yes, all legitimate carriers must have <strong>cargo insurance (minimum $750,000)</strong>. However, coverage varies and may have deductibles. Review the carrier's insurance certificate before shipping and consider gap coverage from the broker. Document your car's condition with photos before pickup."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I choose open or enclosed transport?",
    answer: "<strong>Open transport</strong> is the standard, cost-effective option suitable for most vehicles. <strong>Enclosed transport</strong> costs 40-60% more but protects vehicles from weather and road debris—recommended for luxury cars, classics, exotics, or vehicles worth over $70,000."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do to prepare my car for shipping?",
    answer: "Remove personal items (not covered by insurance), disable toll transponders, leave only <strong>1/4 tank of gas</strong>, note existing damage with photos, disable alarms, and ensure the car is operable. Keep one set of keys for pickup and provide another to the carrier."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I put belongings in my car during transport?",
    answer: "While some carriers allow up to 100 lbs of items in the trunk, <strong>personal belongings aren't covered</strong> by carrier insurance. Most carriers prohibit items for liability reasons. It's best to ship belongings separately or through a moving company."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my car is damaged during transport?",
    answer: "Inspect your vehicle thoroughly at delivery and <strong>note any damage on the Bill of Lading</strong> before signing. Take photos and file a claim with the carrier's insurance immediately. Reputable brokers like Sherpa and Montway offer additional protection and claims assistance."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I verify an auto transport company is legitimate?",
    answer: "Check the broker's <strong>FMCSA registration</strong> at safer.fmcsa.dot.gov. Verify their DOT and MC numbers, review BBB rating and complaints, read customer reviews on multiple platforms, and confirm insurance coverage amounts. Get everything in writing before booking."

        <h2>Open vs Enclosed Transport</h2>

        <h3>Open Transport (Standard)</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Most vehicles—daily drivers, newer cars in good condition, vehicles under $70,000. Most cost-effective option with faster carrier availability.</p>

        <h3>Enclosed Transport (Premium)</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Luxury vehicles, classics, exotics, show cars, vehicles over $70,000. Complete protection from elements with higher insurance. Costs 40-60% more.</p>

          <p><strong>Warning signs:</strong> Extremely low quotes, large upfront deposits, no physical address, pressure to book immediately, unlicensed/uninsured carriers, no written contract, poor or no reviews. Always verify FMCSA registration at safer.fmcsa.dot.gov.</p>
