const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What internet speed do I need?",
    answer: "For basic browsing and email, <strong>25 Mbps</strong> is sufficient. For streaming HD video, aim for <strong>50-100 Mbps</strong>. Households with multiple users streaming 4K, gaming, or working from home should consider <strong>200+ Mbps</strong>. Heavy users and smart homes may benefit from <strong>gigabit (1000 Mbps)</strong> speeds."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between fiber and cable internet?",
    answer: "<strong>Fiber internet</strong> uses light signals through glass cables, offering the fastest and most reliable speeds with symmetrical upload/download. <strong>Cable</strong> uses coaxial cables shared with TV service, typically offering fast downloads but slower uploads. Fiber is generally superior but less widely available (35% of U.S. vs. 89% for cable)."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do internet prices increase after the first year?",
    answer: "Most providers offer <strong>promotional pricing</strong> to attract new customers, then switch to regular rates after 12-24 months. To avoid surprises, always check the regular price before signing up. Providers with stable pricing include <strong>Spectrum</strong> (no contract, predictable increases), <strong>CenturyLink</strong> (Price for Life), and <strong>T-Mobile</strong> (fixed $50/month)."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I rent or buy my modem/router?",
    answer: "Buying your own equipment typically saves money long-term—rental fees of <strong>$10-15/month</strong> add up to $120-180/year. A quality modem/router costs $100-200 and lasts 5+ years. However, some providers include equipment free: <strong>Spectrum</strong> (modem), <strong>AT&T Fiber</strong> (gateway), <strong>Google Fiber</strong> (full setup)."
  },
  {
    question: "What are data caps and which providers have them?",
    answer: "Data caps limit how much data you can use monthly (typically 1-1.5TB). Exceeding caps results in overage fees or throttled speeds. <strong>Providers without data caps:</strong> Verizon Fios, AT&T Fiber, Google Fiber, Spectrum, T-Mobile 5G, Frontier Fiber. <strong>Providers with caps:</strong> Xfinity (1.2TB), Cox (1.28TB)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is 5G home internet as good as cable or fiber?",
    answer: "5G home internet (T-Mobile, Verizon) can match cable speeds in areas with strong coverage but may be <strong>less consistent</strong> due to network congestion and obstacles. Typical speeds are 100-300 Mbps. It's excellent for renters or those wanting easy setup, but <strong>fiber remains superior</strong> for maximum reliability and speed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I bundle internet with TV and phone?",
    answer: "Yes, most major providers offer bundles that can save money. However, <strong>streaming services have made TV bundles less attractive</strong> for many households. Compare: internet-only ($50-70) + streaming ($15-50) vs. cable bundle ($100-150+). Bundles make sense if you watch live sports or want landline phone service."
  },
  {
    question: "Which provider is best for gaming?",
    answer: "For gaming, prioritize <strong>low latency</strong> over raw speed. <strong>Fiber providers</strong> (Verizon Fios, AT&T Fiber, Google Fiber) offer the lowest latency. <strong>Cox</strong> has a dedicated Elite Gamer add-on ($6.99/mo) that optimizes routing. Avoid satellite internet (high latency) for competitive gaming."

        <h2>Data Caps Explained</h2>
        <p>Many cable providers impose <strong>1-1.25TB monthly data caps</strong>. For reference: 1TB equals ~500 hours of HD streaming. 4K uses 4-7GB/hour, gaming uses 40-300MB/hour.</p>

        <div class="key-takeaway">
          <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg> Providers with NO Data Caps</h4>
          <p><strong>Fiber:</strong> Verizon Fios, AT&T Fiber, Google Fiber, Frontier Fiber<br/>
          <strong>Cable:</strong> Spectrum<br/>
          <strong>5G:</strong> T-Mobile 5G Home Internet</p>
        </div>

        <h2>True Cost Analysis</h2>
        <p>Look beyond promotional pricing. Calculate: <strong>Year 1 cost</strong> (promo rate) + <strong>Year 2+ cost</strong> (regular rate) + <strong>Equipment fees</strong> ($10-15/mo if renting) + <strong>Installation</strong>.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
          <h4><svg class="inline-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M12 9v2m0 4h.01m-6.938 4h13.856c1.54 0 2.502-1.667 1.732-3L13.732 4c-.77-1.333-2.694-1.333-3.464 0L3.34 16c-.77 1.333.192 3 1.732 3z" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/></svg> Watch Out for Price Increases</h4>
          <p>Most promotional rates last 12-24 months. <strong>Xfinity</strong> and <strong>Cox</strong> typically increase $20-40/month after promos. <strong>Spectrum</strong> and <strong>CenturyLink (Price for Life)</strong> offer more stable pricing.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>For most households, <strong>Verizon Fios</strong> or <strong>AT&T Fiber</strong> offers the best combination of speed, reliability, and no data caps—if available. Where fiber isn't an option, <strong>Spectrum</strong> provides solid cable service without contracts or data caps.</p>
        
        <p>Budget-conscious customers should consider <strong>T-Mobile 5G Home Internet</strong> for its simplicity and fixed $50/month pricing, while rural residents may find <strong>Starlink</strong> to be their best high-speed option.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-[#68727C] italic mt-6">Prices and availability vary by location. Check provider websites for exact offerings at your address.</p>
