        <h2>Use Of Our Services Is For Informational Purposes Only</h2>
        
        <p>
          <strong>You are Responsible for Your Financial Decisions.</strong> Our Services are intended only to assist you with financial decisions, are broad in scope, and do not consider your personal financial situation. Your personal financial situation is unique and the information and advice may not be appropriate for your situation. Accordingly, before making any final decisions or implementing any financial strategy, we recommend that you obtain additional information and advice of your accountant and other financial advisors who are fully aware of your individual circumstances.
        </p>

        <p>
          We and our affiliates, through the Services, may provide a venue through which you can obtain information about certain financial products and services, and find third-party service providers and advertisers, such as financial institutions, credit card issuers, insurance companies, and other financial professionals ("Service Providers"). Any opinions, advice, information, and other materials made accessible through the Services are for information purposes only.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>We are not an agent or advisor to you or any Service Provider.</strong> We do not validate or investigate the licensing, certification or other requirements and qualifications of Service Providers. We do not guarantee that the terms or rates offered by any particular advertiser, business partner, affiliate, Service Provider or other third party on or through our Services are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market. It is your responsibility to investigate Service Providers, and you acknowledge and agree that you rely on your own judgment in selecting any products or services.
        </p>

        <h2>Acknowledgment That We Are Not a Service Provider</h2>

        <p>
          Our Services act as a forum to connect users with Service Providers, and to provide information about consumer financial products and services. <strong>We are not a financial institution, credit card issuer, insurance provider, or other Service Provider.</strong> We do not, and will not, make any coverage or credit decision with any Service Provider referred to you. We do not issue credit cards, insurance policies, or any other financial products.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Service Providers are solely responsible for any services they provide to you.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that Service Providers are solely responsible for any services that they may provide to you, and that we are not liable for any losses, costs, damages or claims in connection with, arising from, or related to, your use of a Service Provider's products or services.
