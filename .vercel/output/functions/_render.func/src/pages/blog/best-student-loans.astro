  {
    question: "Should I get federal or private student loans?",
    answer: "Always exhaust federal student loans first—they offer income-driven repayment, forgiveness programs, and fixed rates regardless of credit. Private loans should supplement federal aid, not replace it. Private loans make sense when federal limits aren't sufficient or when you qualify for lower private rates."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need for private student loans?",
    answer: "Most private lenders require a credit score of 670+ for approval without a cosigner. The best rates (under 6%) typically require 750+ scores. Students with limited credit history usually need a creditworthy cosigner to qualify for competitive rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I refinance student loans while still in school?",
    answer: "Generally, you can't refinance until after graduation when you have income. Some lenders offer consolidation during school, but true refinancing requires employment. Focus on federal loans during school and consider refinancing after you have stable income and good credit."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between fixed and variable rates?",
    answer: "Fixed rates stay the same throughout your loan term, providing predictable payments. Variable rates start lower but fluctuate with market conditions—potentially increasing significantly over time. Variable rates work best for shorter loan terms (under 5 years) or if you plan to pay off quickly."
  },
  {
    question: "How does a cosigner affect my loan?",
    answer: "A creditworthy cosigner can dramatically lower your interest rate and improve approval odds. However, your cosigner is equally responsible for the debt—late payments affect their credit too. Some lenders offer cosigner release after 12-24 on-time payments."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I refinance federal student loans?",
    answer: "Refinancing federal loans converts them to private loans, permanently losing federal benefits like income-driven repayment, forbearance, and loan forgiveness programs. Only refinance federal loans if you won't need these protections, have stable income, and can get a significantly lower rate."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I borrow with private student loans?",
    answer: "Private loan limits vary by lender but typically cover up to 100% of school-certified cost of attendance minus other financial aid. Annual limits range from $5,000 to $150,000+ depending on program and creditworthiness. Aggregate limits may apply across all private loans."

## Understanding Private Student Loans

Private student loans fill the gap between federal aid and the true cost of education. While federal loans offer important protections, private loans can provide additional funding—sometimes at competitive rates for well-qualified borrowers.

### Federal vs Private: Key Differences

| Feature | Federal Loans | Private Loans |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Credit Check | Not required (except PLUS) | Required |
| Interest Rates | Fixed by Congress | Based on creditworthiness |
| Repayment Options | Income-driven, forgiveness | Varies by lender |
| Borrowing Limits | Set annually | Up to cost of attendance |
| Cosigner | Not required | Often needed |
| In-School Payments | Deferred | Options vary |

### Always Borrow Federal First

Before considering private loans:
1. Complete the **FAFSA** to access federal aid
2. Accept all **federal grants** (free money)
3. Accept **federal subsidized loans** (no interest while in school)
4. Accept **federal unsubsidized loans**
5. Then consider **private loans** for remaining gap

## How to Get the Best Private Student Loan Rate

### Factors Affecting Your Rate

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Credit Score | Most important—affects rate significantly |
| Income | Higher income = lower rates |
| School | Some lenders favor certain institutions |
| Degree Program | Future earning potential considered |
| Cosigner | Can dramatically lower rate |
| Loan Term | Shorter terms = lower rates |

### Rate Comparison by Credit Profile

| Credit Score | Estimated Rate Range |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 750+ | 5.49% - 7.50% |
| 700-749 | 7.00% - 9.50% |
| 650-699 | 8.50% - 11.50% |
| Below 650 | Often requires cosigner |

## Types of Private Student Loans

### Undergraduate Loans

For bachelor's degree students, covering tuition, housing, books, and living expenses. Usually require cosigner for best rates.

### Graduate Student Loans

For master's, professional, and doctoral programs. Often have higher limits and may not require cosigner due to career prospects.

### Parent Loans

Allow parents to borrow for their child's education. Parent is the primary borrower—student is not responsible.

### Medical/Dental/Law School Loans

Specialized loans for professional programs with higher limits and potentially deferred repayment through residency.

## Repayment Options Explained

### Immediate Repayment

Start full payments immediately. **Lowest total cost** but requires income during school.

### Interest-Only Payments

Pay only interest while in school. **Reduces total debt** compared to full deferment.

### Partial Payment

Fixed small payments ($25-$50/month) during school. **Balance between cost and cash flow.**

### Full Deferment

No payments until after graduation. **Most expensive** due to capitalized interest but preserves cash flow.

## Understanding Interest Capitalization

When you defer payments, unpaid interest **capitalizes** (adds to principal). This significantly increases total loan cost.

Example on $30,000 loan at 7%:
- Interest accrued during 4 years: ~$8,400
- After capitalization: $38,400 principal
- Interest now compounds on higher balance

**Tip:** Even small interest payments during school prevent capitalization and save thousands.

## Cosigner Considerations

### Why Use a Cosigner

- **Lower interest rate:** Often 2-3% reduction
- **Higher approval odds:** Especially for young borrowers
- **Higher loan limits:** May qualify for more

### Cosigner Responsibilities

- Equally liable for entire loan
- Payments affect cosigner's credit
- Delinquency impacts both parties
- May affect cosigner's borrowing ability

### Cosigner Release

Some lenders release cosigners after 12-48 consecutive on-time payments. Not all lenders offer this—verify before borrowing if important to you.

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Warning Signs

- **Guaranteed approval:** Legitimate lenders check credit
- **Upfront fees:** Reputable lenders don't charge application fees
- **Pressure tactics:** Take time to compare options
- **No clear terms:** All rates and terms should be disclosed
- **Unknown lenders:** Research company reputation

## The Bottom Line

For most students with good credit, **SoFi** or **Earnest** offer the best combination of low rates, no fees, and borrower-friendly features. **Discover** rewards academic achievement with cash bonuses for good grades.

Students without a cosigner should explore **Ascent** (upperclassmen) or **MPOWER** (international students). Always exhaust federal loan options before turning to private lenders.
