## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Carrying a Balance

Cash back is worthless if you pay interest:
- 20% APR destroys any 2-6% cash back
- Always pay in full
- Set up autopay

### 2. Chasing Bonuses Over Value

Don't overspend for rewards:
- Only buy what you'd buy anyway
- Sign-up bonuses shouldn't drive unnecessary spending

### 3. Using Wrong Card

Missing out on bonus categories:
- Know which card for each category
- Label cards or use wallet organization
- Set default cards by merchant on phone

### 4. Ignoring Shopping Portals

Leaving money on the table:
- Check portals before every online purchase
- Browser extensions automate this
- Extra 1-15% adds up

### 5. Forgetting to Activate

Quarterly category activation:
- Set calendar reminders
- Activate day categories go live
- Check all rotating category cards

## Annual Cash Back Projection

### Conservative Strategy (Flat 2%)
- Annual spending: $30,000
- Cash back earned: $600

### Moderate Optimization
- Category bonuses on 40% of spending
- Average effective rate: 3%
- Cash back earned: $900

### Full Optimization
- Maximized categories + portals

- Cash back earned: $1,200+

## Take Action

1. **Audit your current cards** - Know your earning rates
2. **Identify your top spending categories** - Where does your money go?
3. **Fill portfolio gaps** - Get cards for top categories
4. **Install shopping portal extensions** - Automate extra earnings
5. **Set up category activation reminders** - Never miss 5% quarters
6. **Track and optimize** - Review monthly, adjust strategy

Cash back rewards are the simplest path to free money. With a strategic approach, you can earn $1,000+ annually just by using the right card for each purchase.
